If there is not that possibility, the school should rent\nthe land at an appropriate place (see below). The school can also get the land from the local community, coop-\neratives or associations. Such procedure should be discussed with DM TVET in advance, as the way of paying\nthe rent should be confirmed beforehand. If you have to rent the land, be sure that it is done with a long-term\nperspective!\nThe basic requirements for the field plots which\nyou, as Ahs management and responsible teAChers,\nhAVe to ensure:\n1. Accessibility: location has to be accessible for students and teachers, close to the school building or within\nwalking distance; in case of longer distance, the transportation should be available; also the transportation of\nthe school farm products to the local markets should be possible;\n2. Security: the security of students, teachers and other workers must be guaranteed; place should be protected\nagainst property damages; the boarders should be marked and fenced if possible\n3. Cleanness: the place has to be cleaned – no waste or garbage should be there; avoid the contaminated\nplots!\n4. Facilities: if possible some sheds or storages for the basic equipment should be at the place; don’t forget\nabout hygiene and sanitation (latrines); a place for a compost should be secured; trenches and greenhouses\nshould be set here; the nurseries should also be included.\n5. Watering: a watering source sufficient for the whole plot should be there (well, stream, river, tanks, candas,\nwhole-year accessible watering channel, etc.)\n6. The Shape: if relevant, the place should be accessible by the basic mechanization (tractors, combines etc.) +\navoid the full-shade places, extremely sloped plots etc.\n7. Soil: it should have the adequate quality for the cultivation of different corps/plants (e.g. rocks and big stones\nshould be removed, field leveled, terraces prepared, soil fertility should be checked, etc.); humidity of the plot\nshould be checked in advance – be careful with long-term mud soils– check the drainage; avoid the weeded\nplots or be ready to eliminate the weeds before the cultivation.\n9",

        "examples of best practice": "AND Key CONCLUSIONS\nAll of the interviewed schools considered the introduction of practical teaching to be a great success and if they\nhad the option again, they would do it even earlier. They advise the other school managers to ensure the initial\nconditions (some land) and to encourage their teachers and students to actively participate in this type of educa-\ntion (see the benefits mentioned above). Schools should start with the introduction of the practical teaching of\nthe plant production and once they establish the school farm they should continue with the animal production.\nOnce you manage those two fields, you should introduce the practical teaching in specialized subjects as second-\nary production (post-harvest technologies, animal products processing selling and marketing, financial and farm\nmanagement etc.). Students can gain practical comprehensive knowledge and experiences in one place – at the\nschool farm – as they are actively involved at the plant production, animal production, and secondary production\nand in the school farm management - product selling, marketing, financial and farm management, etc.\nThis type of education can help to solve many of Afghan agriculture’s large problems as it educates real experts\nand hands-on experienced agriculture professionals.\n57"

    "preamble": "intRoduCtion\nAgriculture is the main source of Afghan economical income. Based on the report by the Ministry of Agriculture\nIrrigation and Livestock (MAIL) and UN (FAO), over 77 % of Afghan population is involved in agriculture. In real-\nity, just 12% of the farming land, mostly located in scattered valleys, is cultivated.\nTo improve this situation, Afghan agriculture needs professional agricultural experts to be involved in the field.\nHands-on teaching practiced in schools strengthens the expert competences and skills of the Agriculture High\nSchools and Institutes (AHS, AVI, AI) students and their teachers. It is not just a part of the curriculum, but\nif professionally applied, it is a great example of the income generating activities - in terms of products (e.g.\nhealthy agriculture products for the school canteen) and/or in terms of free funds (used for the development of\nthe school farm and supporting other school activities).\nStudents involved in this type of education gain the complementary knowledge to the theories and gain practi-\ncal experiences with different agricultural topics - e.g. environmental protection, crop cultivation, postharvest\nmethodologies, sales of the agriculture product, marketing, financial management etc. Students participating in\nthe hands-on education are ready for their future jobs and careers.\nThe main objective of this Handbook is to guide school management, students and teachers in the introduction\nor improvement of the hands-on education (practical teaching) system at their school farms.\nIt is obvious that such practices can’t be successful without the support of the school management and active\nparticipation of teachers and students. At the beginning, school management should provide some farming plot\n(setting the school farm) and actively support the teachers and students in such activities. Later, the local farm-\ners, agricultural institutions and other stakeholders should be involved in these school farms.\nThis Handbook focuses on the field of plant production and provides two types of concrete and specific informa-\ntion for the successful hands-on teaching implementation.\nFirst part –",
