The support of Tha\nNwai (AFAOR Admin) and the HR, procurement and logistic teams are commendable inspite of\nchallenging times in the country. Project team support remained crucial especially Le Le Win, Myint\nMyint Aye and Nem Nei Lhing in terms of value addition and better contextualization of the manual.\nWe esteem the technical support of Dr Myint Thaung who remained the project consultant for\ndevelopment of integrated crop management (ICM) handbooks for the target crops GAP. His\nimmense knowledge and expertise were very useful for the training manual and will remain a source\nof learning in the days to come.\nWe thank the researchers, farmers and GAP stakeholders whose work provided a rich source of\nsecondary information and validation of scientific parameters used in the manual.\nNumerous valuable knowledge resources, articles, discussion and research papers were used in the\nmanual. The four interpretive guides of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) GAP\nproved a valuable source of information, guidance and validation for the three aspects of GAP i.e.\nfood safety, produce quality, environmental management and workers health and",

The global trade in food commodities has further necessitated compliance\nto food safety, hygiene and environmental sustainability. Food commodities produced through climate\nsmart ways in terms of compliance to good agricultural and environmentally sustainable standards can\nenhance produce/product competitiveness in the national and international markets. Moreover, food\nsafety is integral to the food and nutrition security of the local population. Capacity building of\nrelevant stakeholders including GAP farmers is imperative for promotion of GAP at farmers’ field\nlevel. The current training manual comprise of two volumes, volume one presents general GAP\nguidelines for food safety, produce quality, environmental management and workers safety, hygiene\nand welfare in line with Myanmar and ASEAN GAP key criteria and compliance standards, while\nvolume two focuses target crops specific GAP at pre and post-harvest stages including processing,\npacking/packaging.

IPM emphasizes the growth of a healthy crop with the\nleast possible disruption to agro-ecosystems and encourages natural pest control mechanisms\n(FAO).\nIPM principles\nPractise crop rotation and intercropping the minimize pest infestation through cultural\nmethods.\nUse adequate cultivation techniques such as seedbed sanitation, timely sowing, optimum\nplant population, use of conservation tillage, thining and direct sowing.\nUse pest resistant/tolerant cultivars and standard/certified seed and planting material.\nPractise field sanitation i.e. Removal of affected plants or plant parts, regular cleansing of\nmachinery and equipment.\nProtect and enhance beneficial organisms.\nField observation where feasible warning, forecasting and early diagnosis of insect pests.\nBiological, physical and other non-chemical methods must be preferred over chemical\nmethods if they provide satisfactory pest control.\nPesticides should only be applied as a last resort when there are no adequate non-chemical\nalternatives and use of pesticides is economically justified.\nOnly when the level of infestation exceeds the economic threshold level, then apply\nsites/problem specific pesticides be applied with least side effects on human, health,\npredating /useful insects.\nActivity-12.1.1. Group work on “What is IPM and what are its principles?”\n1. Divide participants into two groups.\n2. Ask participants: What is IPM and what are its key elements/principles? Especially asking the\nfollowing key questions for knowledge sharing and support;\n• What measures do you take when the crop is infested with insect pests and diseases?\n• Do you use only agrochemicals for control/prevention of insect pests and diseases in\nrice/paddy or other methods such as cultural, biological and mechanical are also used?\n• What are the key difficulties you are facing in using IPM?\n• Do you know the Economic Thresh-hold Level of insect pests damages to rice/paddy?\n1203.

Drag the net lightly over the surface of the plants and\nkill any thrips collected.\nRice seedlings normally recover from thrip damage provided water and\nfertilizer are supplied. After thrips infestation, use Nitrogen fertilizer (0.2\nkg/m2) to improve tiller growth.\nEncourage establishment of biological control agents: predatory thrips,\ncoccinellid beetles, anthocorid bugs, and staphylinid beetles.\nUsed DoA recommended pesticiedies for seed treatment.\nActivity-12.1.2.

Ask participants if there are any questions/clarifications.\nKey information for the topic 11.1.3\nTopic 11.1.3. Production systems, land preparation and planting time of rice/paddy\nProduction systems\nBased on the different agro-ecological zones of Myanmar, rice is cultivated under different systems\naccording to the climatic conditions, seasonality aspects, soil type and fertility status, rice varieties\nperformance and water management perspectives, which give a comparative advantage to the country\nin terms of diversity of rice cropping systems.\nNursery raising and transplanting\n1. WBM (Wed bed method):\nWhen water availability is high.\nA seed rate of 30−50 kg for transplanting to 1 hectare of land is sown in the properly puddled and\nlevel bed.\n110One metre wide and with a convenient length, soil is raised 5−10 cm above the field level.\nPre-germinated seeds are broadcasted in the plot with proper drainage system for removal of\nsurplus water.\nOrganic matter (compost/FYM) and other inorganic fertilizers are applied as basal dressing for\nincreased seed vigor and easy uprooting of seedlings.\nDepending on the soil and local climate, normally 15−21 days old seedlings are transplanted to\nthe main field.\n2. Dry bed method (DBM):\nThe nursery is prepared in dry conditions at site which is fully exposed to sun light and has\nuninterrupted access to irrigation water.\nOne tenth of the field sites is spared for nursery cultivation.\nThe bed is prepared through removal of weeds and breaking clods by making it more friable.\nBed level should be 5−10 cm high with 1 metre width and convenient length.\nWell-decomposed crop residues, free of weed seeds are spread over on the nursery bed to\nfacilitate easy uprooting.\nEnsure timely irrigation to avoid damage to the roots and keep the bed partially wet at the time\nof uprooting.\nNursery of 15−21 days old is transplanted into the field.\nDapog method (DM):\nDapog or mat method of nursery raising is especially appropriate for growing short duration\nvarieties and thus less exposed to shocks due to transplanting.\nA 100-metre square field is prepared.\nA seed rate of 40−50 kg is sown for a land of one hectare.\nInsert sheets such as banana leaves or plastic sheets cover the surface by making proper\nboundaries using bamboos shoots or banana sheath\nThe seed is cultivated @ 1 kg 1.5 m-2. Water is sprinkled after sowing, followed by pressing\ndown by flat wooden plank to embed the seeds and make the surface smooth\nThe bed should be kept moist to prevent water stress. The seedlings are transplanted after 9-14\ndays to the main field.\nTransplanting of seedlings\nSeedlings should be transplanted before 25 days after sowing as transplanting of old seedlings\nmay result in low yield.\nIn case the seedlings are long, then tips of the seedlings can be cut for easy handling and\ntransplanting.\nRice production systems:\nSRI: method of rice cultivation for increasing rice production using reduced planting density, use of\nmuch organic manures, using non-flooded/aerobic field conditions and young seedlings planted at\nwider spacing in a square pattern and managing the crop with intermittent irrigation that keeps the soil\nmoist but not inundated and using weeders for weed control and improving aeration (look for details\nin rice GAP standard).\nDirect rice seeding:\nDirect seeded crops require less labor and tend to mature faster than transplanted crops.\nIn this method, plants are not subjected to stresses such as being pulled from the soil and re-\nestablishing fine rootlets. However, they have more competition from weeds.\nDepending on the land preparation method used, direct seeding can be done in two ways:\n1111. Dry direct seeding\nBroadcasting\nBroadcast 60−80 kg of seeds uniformly by hand or in furrows in 1 ha of field.\nMake shallow furrows by passing a furrower along the prepared field.\nAfter broadcasting, cover the seeds using a spike-tooth harrow.\nDrilling\nprecision equipment, such as the turbo happy seeder, can be used to drill seeds;\ndrill 80−100 kg of seeds ha-1;\nseeds are placed by the machine into both dry and moist soil, and then irrigated;\na smooth, level seedbed is necessary to ensure that seeds are not planted at depths greater than\n10−15 mm;\nin this technique, fertilizers can be applied at the same time as the seed; and\nmanual weeding also is easier in machine-drilled crops than in broadcast crops.\nDibbling\nDibbling or hill planting is usually practised along mountain slopes or where plowing and\nharrowing are difficult.\nUse a long wood or bamboo pole with a metal scoop attached at the end for digging holes.\nDrop the seeds into the holes and cover them with soil.\n2. Wet direct seeding\nBroadcasting\nBroadcast 80−100 kg/ha of pre-germinated seeds to recently drained, well-puddled seedbeds or\ninto shallow standing water.\nIf water in the field is muddy, allow 1−2 days for it to dry before broadcasting.\nDrum seeding\nIt operates best on a well-leveled, smooth, and wet seedbed. However, seeders may be clogged if\nthe soil is sticky or if the machine is poorly designed.\nPrepare 80 kg of pre-germinated seeds ha-1\n.\nLand preparation paddy\nPrimary tillage: To prepare the land primary tillage should be done after the harvest of the\nprevious crop or at the end of the fallow period. The land should be tilled at appropriate moisture\nconditions for easy and uniform tillage.\nPrimary tillage can be done through animal or tractor drawn implements such as disc plow,\nmoldboard plows, tined or rotavators upto the depth of 100−150 mm.\nSecondary tillage: Secondary tillage is undertaken after primary tillage by tilling the soil 3−4\ntimes up to 50−75 mm depth, depending the nature of soil and other conditions such as\ncloddiness, level of weed infestation, the need, type and method of fertilizers application as well\nas the need for puddling.\nImplements used for secondary tillage include disc and peg tooth harrows, tined cultivators,\nrotavators.\nPlanting geometry and sowing method\nSeason\nPlanting geometry Seed\nPlant to\nRow to row\n(inches)\nplant\nrate\n(kg/ha)\n(inches)\nPlant\npopulation\nha-1\nSeeding/seedling\ndepth (inches)\n8 6 32−52 322 000 1.5\nTransplanting\n8 8 52 242 000 1.5\n9 6 52 287 000 1.5\n112Wet seeding - - 77 - -\nDry seeding - - 103 - -\nSRI 10 10 4 155 000 1.0\nSource:\nMOALI. 2018.

If the crop is harvested late morning, then\nafternoon, half of the day, the crop should be threshed.\nTo reduce grain losses due to beating effects, wider canvass should be used with raised edges\ndried soon after threshing.\nAppropriate drying is key to the produce quality in terms of taste, aroma, nutrition value and\nlong shelf life.\nDry the grain for 24 hours after threshing, otherwise the grain quality will be lowered due to\nbreaking in the milling.\nThe recommending moisture for sale is 15 percent of seed moisture while it should be 13\npercent for storage.\nEnsure that the spread grain is turned over at regular interval (every 30 minutes) using rakes to\nensure uniform drying.\nSlow drying with moderate temperature is good for preventing cracking as quick drying result\nin broken grains during milling.\nThe surface temperature should not exceed above 36℃ or must be kept lower than 36℃. High\ntemperature can also damage the seed embryo, which in turn decrease seed viability in case of\nusing the grain as seed.\nFor drying of milling rice, about (200–400) baskets of paddy can be dried up to 15 percent of\nseed moisture content at 40–50ºC within 8–10 hour.\nRemove foreign all foreign matter including broken grain, immature grain, shriveled grains for\nattaining high milling recovery.\nAs estimated that to increase mechanical efficiency of milling by five percent and energy\nconsumption if percentage of foreign matter is less than one percent.\nWinnowing trays or sieves should be used and mechanical cleaner for efficient cleaning.\nSmall stones which cannot be removed by winnowing, should be picked by hand.\nActivity-13.1.2.

Stand up if this applies to you\nThis is a good activity to help participants get to know each other.\n• Start with participants sitting.\n• Ask participants to stand if a statement applies to them. For example;\no Stand if you were born in this township or village.\no Stand if you enjoy watching football.\no Stand if you have children.\no Stand if you enjoy listening to music.\no Stand if you like eating mohinga (Myanmar food).\n• Ask participants to sit down after each statement.\n• Think of funny statements but be careful not to embarrass participants or make them feel\nuncomfortable.\n• Then, ask them to introduce themselves.\n2. Match the cards and introduce each other\n• The facilitator chooses a number of well-known phrases, and writes half of each phrase on a\npiece of paper or card.\n• For example, they write ‘Happy’ on one piece of paper and ‘Birthday’ on another.\n• The number of pieces of paper should match the number of participants in the group.\n• The folded pieces of paper are put into a hat.\n• Each participant takes a piece of paper from the hat and tries to find the member of the group\nwith the matching half of the phrase.\n• Then, the partners introduce each other.\n3. Gesture with your name\nThis is a good activity to help participants get to know each other’s at the beginning of a workshop:\n• Ask participants to sit or stand in a circle.\n• Explain that each person must say their name and then perform a gesture, which they feel\nexpresses something unique about them.\n• Demonstrate a couple of gestures yourself such as reaching out your arms, hiding your face\nbehind your hands (to represent shyness, for example), bowing (to represent politeness) or\nkicking a pretend ball (to represent interest in football).\n• Explain that after each",
            "introduction": ", participants should say “hello…” and perform the name and gesture of\nthe participant they are meeting.\n• Participants then take turns to introduce themselves this way.\n158B. Energizers\n1. Robots\n• Divide the participants into groups of three.\n• One person in each group is the robot controller and the other two are the robots.\n• Each controller must manage the movements of their two robots.\n• The controller touches a robot on the right shoulder to move them to the right, and touches them\non the left shoulder to move them to the left.\n• The facilitator begins the game by telling the robots to walk in a specific direction.\n• The controller must try to stop the robots from crashing into obstacles such as chairs and tables.\n• Ask participants to swap roles so that everyone has a chance to be the controller and a robot.\n2. Move to the Spot\nThis can be an enjoyable game, as long as it does not go on for too long. It should probably be\nbrought to an end after three or four peoples have had the chance to be the leader. The danger is that\npeople will stick close to their spots.\n• Clear the center of the room or find an open space outside.\n• Each group member is instructed to choose and stand in an open spot.\n• Instruct people to walk around and do one of the following;\no say hello to all those who wearing red/blue;\no look up as you walk;\no walk backward;\no hop (or skip or jump);\no make a sound or whistle;\no keep one (or both) eye(s) closed; and\no in as much of a straight line as possible.\n• When you say stop, everyone must run to his or her original spot.
