        "Guiding Principles": "Activities based on capacity building, technical assistance, and the transferring of Israeli knowhow, innovation, technologies and expertise Focus in sectors in which Israel has accumulated expertise and a comparative advantage MASHAV believes that development cooperation should and can be used to forge bonds of peaceful cooperation between Israel and its neighbors Demand-driven programming and active consultation with local partners Pursuing multi-stakeholder partnerships with the civil society and private sector to achieve the SDGs Holistic, inclusive and integrative approach to development Engaging in Guided by bilateral, trilateral and multilateral development cooperation creating synergies between complimentary strengths universal principles for the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 2 Guiding Principles Foreword by the Head OF 2024 was another challenging year for us in Israel, both personally and professionally. The ongoing war, the multiple threats – south, north, and east of the country, the challenges facing shattered families, destroyed communities, hundreds of thousands of internally displaced people, and most of all – the enormous loss, the pain and the fear regarding the fate of the Israeli hostages in Gaza, kept us away from any sense of closure and introduced difficult choices. These strained circumstances shaped our lives, and their shadows are reflected in every aspect, without exception. Yet, as we constantly engage in further galvanizing our resilience, despite all complexities, including budget constraints, MASHAV continues its quest, promoting sustainable development and implementing training and capacity-building programs in collaboration with our partners. The bright moments during this year were the release days of hostages, who had spent long months, some more than a year and a few months, in captivity, held by Hamas and Islamic Jihad's terrorists in Gaza (76 hostages are still held in captivity as I write these paragraphs). Among those released were agricultural and development experts who had worked and partnered closely with MASHAV for decades. One of the agronomists was held hostage for 482 (!) days. We hope they will continue their invaluable work in the future, benefiting the world. Dozens of people are still held in Gaza; among them are two foreign agriculture students who were kidnapped during the October 7 massacre from southern Israel while participating in the Internship in Agriculture Program. We pray for the immediate and safe release of all the hostages who remain in captivity. As the war persisted throughout 2024, MASHAV's training centers continued to offer assistance to the displaced communities. Due to the unstable security situation and massive rocket shelling, particularly in northern Israel, some training sessions had to be conducted online. However, others were held in person in Israel. We were happy to welcome our partners for international capacity-building courses here and kept nourishing our investment in human capital. We sent experts on consulting and training missions abroad and continued to collaborate with numerous local and international partners. We continued to develop existing and new centers of excellence in agriculture and emergency medicine, supervised projects established by MASHAV together with local partners in previous years, and supported innovative initiatives suggested and implemented by our alumni around the globe. The hardships faced at home, during 2024, did not reduce our commitment to provide humanitarian assistance to countries and communities facing natural and manmade disasters, such as fires, droughts, earthquakes, and floods, as well as the continued support of our partners in Ukraine, providing assistance and, most importantly, tailor- made capacity-building programs on trauma care, community resilience, and more, sharing our own experiences. At MASHAV, we remain committed to promoting our goals, which are aligned with the Global Agenda 2030. This commitment is reflected in the 2024 MASHAV Activity Report, which I am honored to present to you – wishing us all long-lasting peace.
