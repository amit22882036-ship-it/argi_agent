  "1. THE CHALLENGES OF ORGANIC FARMING": "Switching to organic farming or adopting organic farming techniques and practices on a conventional farm takes time and planning. It is not merely a case of hoeing, weeding or using a rotary hoe instead of spraying. Rather, the entire farming approach must be adapted to the new method, including crop rotation, tillage, seedbed preparation, catch crops, undersowing, etc. Choosing the perfect moment and being highly precise is vital when it comes to using machinery for mechanical weed control, especially when compared to conventional areas where such techniques are not used. Simply replacing spraying with a hoe or a weeder is not enough.\n\n**Why adopt mechanical soil cultivation?**\n» Organic/eco-agriculture\n» Legal reduction (quantity restrictions) or bans on pesticides\n» Reduction/loss of active ingredients or resistance\n» Minimum distances to bodies of water\n» Social acceptance of pesticides\n» Market requirements / demand\n» Soil improvement\n» etc",
  "2. THE ADVANTAGES OF SUSTAINABLE ARABLE FARMING": "\"For the cultivated crop:\\n» Mechanical removal of weeds and weed grasses for improved crop development\\n» Weeds in the row are covered by soil and the cultivated crop is hilled\\n» Promotion of plant & root development thanks to humus-rich soil\\n» Reduction in water usage thanks to interrupting the capillary effect, more water is available to the crops\\n» Avoidance of unnecessary stress on the crop because of the use of herbicides\\n\\nFor the soil:\\n» Increase in soil moisture and aeration, incrustations broken up after heavy rainfall\\n» Nutrient mobilisation - resulting in increased microorganism activity\\n» Gentle humus tillage – shallow cultivation of the top soil layer\\n\\nFor the environment:\\n» Avoidance of pesticides\\n» Less need for additional active substances\\n» Weed resistance development prevented\\n» Incorporation of (organic) fertiliser - fertiliser mineralisation\\n» e.g. incorporation of liquid manure, mineral fertiliser or urea\\n» Increased nutrient release: \"twice weeded/hoed = once fertilised\"\\n» Improvement of soil fertility, a more resistant and healthy soil is promoted\\n» Protection of waters\\n» Conservation of species diversity, biodiversity supported\"",

  "4. CROP ROTATION": {
      "4": "The interrelation between plants promotes diversity,\ngood soil fertility, “independent” weed control and an\noptimum supply of nutrients. In arable farming, this\nsymbiosis is achieved by growing plants in succession.\nEach plant needs a different mix of nutrients to grow.\nWell-planned crop rotation is therefore central to\neconomic success. Crop rotation enhances soil fertility,\nthereby supporting positive yields long term. In\norganic farming, there is little sense in growing crops\nwithout suitable crop rotations, as the harvests you\nwould achieve, would not be good enough.\nCultivation breaks must also be adhered to. There\nare many different parameters to take into account,\nsuch as location, soil condition, plant cultivation\nfactors (nutrient supply, soil fertility, etc.), as well\nas operational and market factors. Each crop must\nfulfil its respective task within the crop rotation, and\ncrops cannot be simply swapped about. In organic\nfarming, mistakes made in crop rotations are difficult\nto correct due to the lack of chemical pesticides and\nnitrogen fertilisation. It can be extremely complex to\nachieve long-term farming goals, such as increasing\nthe humus, controlling weeds, preventing disease and\npest infestations.\nAligned crop rotations minimise weed pressure!",

Similar to appropriate crop rotation, catch\ncrops can be an effective method to suppress weeds.\nCatch crops have the ability to suppress weeds, just\nlike crop rotations do. Diverse, year-round rooting and\ncontinuous, vigorous growth.\nCatch crops are used for the following objectives:\n» To feed soil life\n» To promote root exudation, which is responsible\nfor soil organism nutrient supply.

The correct mix is\ncrucial. To achieve the best results, avoid using catch\ncrops, green fallow and undersown crops that are from\nHere are a few practical examples:\n» After a crop of peas, avoid sowing more peas,\nlupins, vetches or field beans. Peas are particularly\nsensitive to diseases caused by crop rotation.\n» The same applies (although to a lesser degree) to\nlupins and field beans. After a main crop of field\nbeans, do not use (grain) legumes as the catch crop.\nMustard and oil radish are cruciferous plants. They\nshould therefore not be sown after oilseed rape\ndue to the risk of cabbage hernia, Verticillium rape\nwilt and Sclerotinia white stem disease.\n» Sugar beet can be decimated by nematode-\nresistant mustard and oil radish varieties.\n» To improve soil fertility\n» Humus formation\n» As \"nutrient replenishment\" thanks to the catch\ncrop\n» Breaking up the main crop rotation\n» To promote the proliferation and activity of\nmycorrhiza and microorganisms\n» To promote straw rot\n» As protection against erosion, particularly in\nhillside locations\nthe same plant family as the main crop.\n» Oil radish is a deep-rooting crop, which makes\nit ideal for loosening the soil for cereal crop\nrotations. Phacelia and mustard must not be\nincluded in potato crop rotations because they pass\non Rattle Virus (a pathogenic plant virus).\n_\nCatch crops maintain the soil cover year round promoting soil life!\nEinböck: The Organic Farming Handbook\n2 5\nWeed control\nCatch crops can provide effective weed control for\nlate weed crops. These are often otherwise difficult to\nmanage (e.g. thistle, dock). Plants compete for sunlight,\nmeaning light deprivation can be more effective than\ntillage. This makes this method preferable. A minimum\nof one catch crop element should feature rapid\njuvenile development, e.g. oats, buckwheat, camelina,\nmongoose, etc.\nNitrogen extraction\nLegumes have the ability to bind atmospheric\nnitrogen. The wide range of types of legume are ideal\nfor loosening the soil thanks to their different root\nsystems. Large-grain legumes include peas, lupins and\nvetches, while small-grain legumes include red clover\nand sweet clover.\nUse a wide variety of mixtures\nThe more species you include in a catch crop mixture,\nthe more positive effect this will have on the soil.\nIdeally, include at least 8 different crops in the mixture\nas this will ensure greater biodiversity. To cope with\nadverse and changeable weather conditions, add\ndry-resistant and moisture-loving or reliable frost-\nresistant crops (e.g. ryegrass and cultivated millet) and\nhardy crops to the mixture.\nDue to their vigorous root formation, grasses should\nbe included in every mix. Sweet grasses specifically\noffer considerable advantages: Their robust root\nformation and significant ability to release liquids\n(root exudate) are beneficial to humus enrichment\nand improvement of soil regeneration. Once again, the\ninteraction between mycorrhiza and microorganisms\nis significant.\n_\nThe right mix is key! Rooting abilities, germination conditions, N-fixation, etc.\nMany plant species align with naturally occurring conditions, and offer the following advantages:\n» Certain plant species are more tolerant of adverse\nbeneficial organisms present in the soil.\nweather conditions than others.

    "5.2 Sowing catch crops": "5.2 Sowing catch crops\nCatch crops promote life in soil, however, suitable soil preparation and sowing are crucial when ensuring rapid\nemergence.\nConduct spade tests and take appropriate action.\nWeed treatment or early sowing\nPrepare the seedbed two to four weeks before sowing\nfor weed treatments and repeatedly work the soil using\na straw weeder or cultivator with duckfoot sweeps to a\nshallow depth every 7 - 10 days. Only carry out in dry\nconditions to ensure successful weed treatment. Each\nmechanical pass stimulates new seeds to germinate.\nWeed treatments are extremely effective and can\nprevent weed pressure from annual weeds. In response\nto summer weather conditions and the prevalence of\nweeds, weed treatments may be conducted or catch\ncrops can be sown as early as possible, depending\non the circumstances. Volunteer cereals can usually\nbe suppressed fairly reliably by using a bulky green\nmanure mix. Alternatively, they can be useful as a good\nenrichment for a green manure mix once germinated.\nWhen cereals follow a catch crop, volunteer cereals should not be included in\nthe catch crop to avoid disease transmission.\nSoil cultivation before sowing\nWhen weed treatments are not required, soil should\nbe tilled, and the catch crop sown as early as possible\nafter the grain harvest to cover the bare soil quickly.\nCultivation date rule of thumb\nA later catch crop cultivation date means a shorter\ngrowing season, meaning the date should be as soon\nafter the harvest as possible.\nA good rule of thumb: 1 day in July = roughly 1 week in September / the whole\nof November during the growing season.Sowing catch crops\nThe smaller the seed and the drier the soil, the higher\nthe demands on the seedbed. For uniform and even\ncatch crop emergence, it is essential to consider factors\nsuch as distribution across the entire area, depth of\nplacement, reconsolidation, etc. during the sowing\nprocess. A pass with a \"disc spreader\" will not produce\nthe desired result (e.g. wind drift causes uneven\ndistribution). The most efficient and economical\noption is a pneumatic seed drill mounted on a soil\ntillage implement (cultivator, disc weeder or similar).\nThe aim is to plant the catch crop immediately after the harvest to make\neffective use of the fast-growing summer months.\nA brief summary of catch crop sowing\n» The correct stubble cultivation depth and sowing\nsignificantly reduces undesirable weeds.\n» For the most efficient and economical use of seed,\nwe recommend using a pneumatic seeding box\nmounted on a soil tillage implement or a seed drill.\nSow at the same time as stubble cultivation using a mounted pneumatic seed\ndrill.",
    "5.3 Einböck technology for catch crop distribution": "The P-BOX-STI is a pneumatic seeder with electrical\nquantity dosing. The user-friendly, electric SPEED-\nTRONIC control unit regulates the seed quantity\ndepending on the working speed.

    "5.4 Incorporation of cover crops & catch crops": "In nature, the green sections of plants do not end up in the soil, as such, only rotted material should be worked into\nsoil. Furthermore, earthworms can only make use of plant matter on the soil's surface as actual food.\nThe basics of incorporation\n» Tall crops should be chopped at the right time\n(in the case of flowering crops, protect insects by\nchopping cover crops in the evening, morning or as\na rule, during cooler weather).\n» Chop approx. 2 weeks before incorporating cover\ncrops.\n» Subsequent pre-rotting reduces the anaerobic\ndecomposition risk of the organic matter\n» Do not let the growth lignify, otherwise nitrogen is\nonly released slowly, and this can lead to shortfalls\nin yield.\n» Therefore, do not plough fresh green material too\ndeeply into heavy soil.\n» Do not incorporate winter fertiliser too late on light\nsoils, otherwise the emergence of the main crop\nmay be hindered\n» With easily breakable crops (such as mustard,\nbuckwheat and feld beans), a quick pass with a\nroller is often enough to cause catch crop to die\ndown.\n» Cover crops that are hard to shred (such as clover\nor grasses) must be mulched or mown.\nAvoid ploughing green manure too deeply into the soil.\nIncorporating frozen off cover crops\nCertain crops such as mustard, phacelia and Berseem\nclover can be easily incorporated if they are well dried\nout. They break up superbly just by using a tillage tool\nsuch as a cultivator or rotative/spade weeder Berseem\nclover and phacelia can also be “chopped” when\nfrozen using a Cambridge roller.Incorporating cover crops that have not frozen off\nBe mindful to work carefully when incorporating\nunfrozen vegetation, cover crops might otherwise\ngrow through to the subsequent crop. Special care\nmust be taken with grasses since they are especially\npersistent. It is important to cut into the ground at full\nwidth with either a plough, a wing share cultivator,\nblade cultivator, or a light cultivator with duckfoot\nsweeps.\nThe correct tool depends on the following crop's components, the soil structure\nand the farm’s approach to cultivation.\nIn cases when the soil is not turned, the roots must be\nseparated from the earth as much as possible in order\nto prevent new growth. Good results can be achieved\nwhen using a weeder as a trailing unit or \"beating\"\nrollers. Often, a combination of multiple tillage steps\nat intervals of a few days are necessary to allow the\nstrong plants to die off.It is important to cut across the full working width when incorporating cover\ncrops.\n3 2\n5. Growing catch crops\nCover crops in autumn\nCover crops that freeze off should still be able to\ndevelop sufficiently in autumn to freeze off safely\nin winter and enough mulch material should be left\nbehind for the following crop. Avoid cutting in autumn\ndue to the many negative effects. Moderate winter\ntemperatures contribute to extended vegetation years,\nfostering robust root development in cover crops.\nThis is an advantage when it comes to the build-up of\nhumus in the soil.\nDo not plough catch crops in autumn.\nPloughing in spring.\nIn principle, the catch crop should be left as long as\npossible so that it develops as much as it can. In spring,\ncrop requirements as regards the seedbed must be the\npriority. These differ according to the tillage system,\nthe type of crop and the style of management.\nIn general: Tillage operations should be carried out\nwith caution and only when the field can be easily\nnavigated. During spring, it is important to drive in a\nway that protects the soil and safeguards water (i.e.\nas shallow as possible). Tillage can only be carried out\nwhen the soil conditions are sufficiently dry. Reducing\nthe working speed and adjusting tyre pressures means\nyou are well equipped for the spring drought.\nYou need to take a soil sample before the catch crop is cultivated in spring!\nIt is essential you carry out a precise assessment\nof the catch crop’s development stage. Ploughing\nshould be carried out before seeds ripen to avoid\ngermination of the new seeds. Ploughing after frosty\nnights means that cover crops can be easily mulched\nor flailed. Incorporating the shredded material\naccelerates drying, allowing for optimally preparation\nfor subsequent cultivation. In addition, this improves\nweed suppression and warms the soil more quickly\ndue to soil aeration. These measures should always be\ncoordinated with the crop rotation in order to provide\nit with the best possible supply of nutrients.\nIf spring remains wet, do not drive onto the field.\nShallow incorporation in spring\nShallow incorporation using a cultivator results in\nrapid decomposition. The plant material is separated\nfrom the root and incorporated into the soil allowing\noxygen to enter the soil. This in turn warms up more\nquickly and stimulates microorganism development.\nOnly begin tillage in dry conditions as it is essential\nto allow sufficient time for the soil to dry out in spring.\nIt’s useful to note, that if spring cultivation is delayed\ndue to bad weather, it generally does not reduce the\nyield. Your soil will benefit in years to come from only\ntilling in dry conditions. In contrast, smearing of the\nsoil surface and compaction can cause problems over",
    "5.5 An example of successful cover crop incorporation": "To ensure a good start and to provide a crop with the best possible seedbed, the cover crop must be well shredded.\nIf the catch crops are not too vigorous during winter or if a high proportion of the cover crop is well frozen, the\nshredding steps may not always necessary. This means an initial shallow cultivator pass can be immediately carried\nout. To ensure a successful pass, take note of the following points:\n1. Full-width, clean chop: All plants and weeds still standing should be cut off above the main root zone. A full-\nwidth cut is possible when using the correct line spacing (approx. 15 cm / 5.90\") and duckfoot sweeps that are\nnot too wide (20/22/24 cm / 7.90/8.70/9.40\"). Sweeps must overlap so that vegetation cannot “slip through”.\nUse duckfoot sweeps made from carbide metal - they stay sharp for longer and\nmaintain the cutting width.\nPrecise working depth: The device must be precisely set to the required working depth and must also\nmaintain this depth.\nFlat operation: This mode of action safeguards good capillary water connection for the seed, means that the\nsoil crumbles well and enables optimum penetration even under hard soil conditions.\nWork at a shallow depth - do not work deeper than the subsequent sowing\ndepth.\n2. 3. Break open clods of soil A cultivator with rapidly rotating trailing working tools, such as flat rod crumblers and\nserrated crumblers, separate the soil from the roots: Clods of soil are broken at the root and crushed.\nExpose the roots: A trailing weeder tine with heavy tines levels the soil and deposits the roots on the soil\nsurface. The sun and wind will dry the roots there.\nZERO pressure: To prevent the cover crop from continuing to grow, it must not be pressed down again after it\nhas been cut. The trailing weeder tines ensure any cut vegetation and roots are deposited on the surface. If\nthe roots are free of soil, they will dry out quickly."

  "6. UNDERSOWING & MIXED CROPS": {
      "6": "Undersown crops, i.e. an additional crop to the main\ncrop, can be very advantageous for certain plants.\nSowing undersown crops can increase plant diversity\nand promote rooting of the soil. They also reduce the\nrisk of soil erosion and late weed infestations during\nthe mature phase of the main crop.\nTo truly take advantage of the benefits undersown\ncrops can offer, the right mixing partner needs to\nbe chosen and sowing needs to be carried out in\ncoordination. You must consider competition for space\nfor roots, nutrients, and water.\nLegumes such as clover or clover-grass are well suited to\nundersowing. Due to their slow juvenile development,\ngrasses can fully develop quickly after the main crop\nhas been harvested. Only sow undersown crops with\ncaution when working in dry regions, as crops can\noften lack the necessary water in situations such as\nthis. Drought-resistant legumes such as lucerne or\nkidney vetch can withstand longer periods of drought.\nParticularly suitable as undersown crops: grasses such as white clover, black\nmedic, mustard, camelina, perko or grass-clover, red clover, lucerne.\nAdvantages of undersown and nurse crops & mixtures\n» Weed suppression\n» Protection against crusting and humus erosion\n» Protection due to ever-present cover crop\n» Vegetation can be used as fodder\n» Root penetration for better soil structure\n» Incorporation of organic matter into the soil after\nthreshing\n» Fixation of extra nitrogen\nUndersown, nurse and companion crop challenges\n» Competition between the main crop and the\nundersown crop can lead to poor development of\nthe undersown crop\n» Main crop may overrun due to being deprived of\nwater and nutrients\n» No tillage is possible after harvest\n6.1 Undersowing cereals\n» There is a developmental advantage due to the\nearlier sowing date than is possible for catch crops\n» This approach acts as a cost-saving measure as the\nundersown crop benefits from the light after the\nmain crop is harvested and grows alone. No tillage\nis therefore required\n» Support and underpinning for the main crop\n» Too much or too little seeding strength\n» The right appropriate technology is required for\nthis approach\n» Incorrect timing of sowing\n» Mechanical weed control difficult or not possible\nafter sowing",
    "6.1 Undersowing cereals": "To prevent the undersown crop from overrunning, long-stalking varieties should be used at low-growing cereals\nsuch as winter barley, spring barley, etc. Choosing the right undersown mixture and time is key. After the harvest,\nthe field is already planted. Stubble cultivation, seedbed preparation and sowing of a catch crop is not required.",
    "6.2 Undersowing maize": "A pneumatic seed drill mounted on a row-crop cultivator enables simultaneous sowing of undersown crops\nduring the hoeing pass of the maize crop. This is usually an option for the final hoeing pass. Clover and grasses are\nparticularly suitable for use as undersown crops. Spreading with a weeder-mounted seeder is also an option.\nUnder-sowing maize helps with weed suppression, erosion reduction and offers excellent shading. It also supports\nsoil life and means the soil is more drivable during harvesting thanks to the wide-spread vegetation.\nSow the undersown crop using a row-crop cultivator with pneumatic seed drill\nduring the last hoeing pass.",
    "6.3 Undersowing soy": "The soy bean has slow juvenile development and\nripening, which makes it susceptible to late weed\ninfestations between the rows. Undersowing\ncan suppress these weeds, in addition to careful\nweed control thanks to weeding and hoeing. Note\nthe following key points: The sowing time of the\nundersown crop must be well matched to the soy\nbean to successfully suppress the weeds, while not\nimpairing the soy bean yield. The undersown crop\nmust be a good match for the main crop.\nPerennial ryegrass and white clover in the undersown\nmixture are well suited for this purpose due to their\nrapid ground cover and low height. It can help to sow\nshallow-growing grass and clover varieties at the end\nof the rows as They can significantly improve field\ndriveability when the harvest is wet. For soy, the cutter\nbar has to be lowered very low to the ground, therefore\nchoosing a low but well-rooted undersown crop can\nmake harvesting much easier.",
    "6.4 Mixed crops": "Unlike undersown crops, mixed crops are harvested at\nthe same time as the main crop. Mixed crops support\nthe positive interaction between the mixed plants, as\nwell as offering the same advantages as undersown\ncrops (i.e. soil cover, root penetration, etc.). They\ninclude plant species that promote the health and\ngrowth of other plants. Crops are chosen as mixed\ncrops that will support other species, to make them\nable to be harvested.\nSow the undersown crop on the second weeding pass, between tilling and\nshooting."

  "7. TILLAGE": {
    "7.1 Basic soil cultivation": "Basic soil cultivation includes loosening and mixing\nthe soil. The main aim of good, site-adapted soil\ncultivation is to achieve a healthy soil structure. Soil\nshould have sufficient coarse pores for effective soil\naeration and optimum water drainage In very dry\nconditions, strong reconsolidation may be desirable to\nsave water.\nIt is important to ensure a high proportion of central\npores for water storage and good root penetration\nwithout disturbance layers to achieve a healthy habitat\nthat encourages an active soil life and high stability of\nsoil aggregates. Depending on the soil conditions and\nmoisture your field has, varying amounts of work are\nrequired.\nAn important aspect of basic soil cultivation is to\nloosen the entire surface to create the optimum\nconditions for plants to grow. The right approach must\nbe selected depending on soil conditions present.\nNot every tillage is the same - location is a key factor.\nTillage has a significant effect on the soil and soil\nlife. Repeated exposure of sensitive soil to heavy\nmachinery and agricultural tillage, compacts soil and\nhas a negative effect on the living conditions of soil\norganisms. It increases the chance of erosion, nutrient\nleaching, and a decline in soil fertility.\nAgricultural soil cultivation and usage therefore\nrequires careful, location-specific consideration to\navoid detrimental side effects, while achieving the\ngoal of sustainable, efficient and environmentally\nfriendly soil management.",

They combine the\nadvantages of traditional ploughing with a minimal\nlevel of cultivation. In addition to being well-suited\nto controlling weeds, shallow ploughs ensure rapid\nrotting. Their mode of operation also reduces fungal\ninfestations.\nAdvantages of shallow ploughs over conventional\nploughs\n» Shallow incorporation of harvest residues: Harvest\nresidues remain in contact with oxygen, which\nsupports the decomposition process\n» Soil structure is protected and offers a high load-\nbearing capacity: Only the top few centimetres\nof soil are processed, keeping the gas and water\nbalance at the right levels\n» Preservation of the soil structure safeguards soil\nlife\n» Mechanical control of weeds and volunteer cereals\nhappens at shallower depths than when using a\nconventional plough (up to 20 cm / 7.90\" deep)\n» Avoidance of sole compaction as a result of the\nplough's \"Onland\" driving method\n» Diesel consumption is reduced, since for every\ncentimetre of working depth, 150 tonnes of soil\nhave to be moved per hectare\n» By reducing the power output, the working width\ncan be increased by up to 40% compared to\nregular ploughing\n_\nShallow ploughing combines the advantages of traditional ploughing with those\nof minimum tillage!Conservation tillage / non-rotating\nConservation tillage is characterised by loosening of soil, rather than turning. Plant residues remain as close as\npossible to the soil surface (mulch). Equipment should be used for this kind of soil cultivation that transfers a great\ndeal of power indirectly to the soil, and crushes as little as possible. Cultivators and disc weeders are some of the\nmost important tools in non-rotating tillage.\nUsing a cultivator for primary tillage has gained significant traction over the past few years (new developments in\ncultivators, increased acreage performance, water savings, erosion reduction, soil protection, etc.).\nCultivator advantages\n» Soil structure is not reversed – stable soil\naggregates can develop in the upper soil layer\n» Protection of soil life, which is a plus for the\nearthworm population and fungi\n» Organic matter mixed with all topsoil: Favourable\nrotting conditions, efficient conversion of organic\nmatter to humus, no straw mats, protective mulch\ncover\n» Increase in number of medium pores – improved\nwater holding capacity in soil\n» Increased acreage performance\n» Lower diesel consumption for flat work\n» Less unproductive evaporation\n» Good erosion protection\n» No plough pan formation\nCultivator disadvantages\n» Crop residues or mulch layer remains on the\nsurface and makes mechanical weed control more\ndifficult\n» Higher demand for seedbed preparation\n» Higher demands on sowing equipment (disc\ncoulters)\n» Fewer large pores than with ploughing\n» Limited use in very heavy and compact soils\n» Higher demands on weeding and cultivator\ntechnology due to the increased quantity of\norganic material on the soil surface\n» This machinery is difficult to use and gives poor\nresults on very moist soils, i.e. in wet conditions\n» Weed pressure may be increased\n_\nCultivators offer many benefits. They have therefore become increasingly\nimportant in recent years.Strip sowing *\nStrip-till sowing is a strip sowing method that cultivates\nonly a narrow strip of soil around the sowing sweep. In\nessence, this is a compromise between mulch sowing (a\nploughless sowing method preceded by conservation\ntillage) and direct sowing (sowing without any tillage,\nafter harvesting). Roughly two thirds of the soil remain\nuncultivated and covered with dead or living plant\nmaterial. According to the principle of first loosening\nand fertilising, then sowing, organic and/or mineral\nfertilisers are placed in a highly concentrated form in\nthe root zone of the main crop.\n\"Strip-till\" is generally only used for row crops (such as maize, soy, pumpkin,\nsugar beet, etc.) to ensure sufficient row spacings.\n\"Strip-Till” advantages\n» The potential for erosion control is increased by\nthe straw and mulch cover and the uncultivated\nsections’ water infiltration. The water content\nin the topsoil is increased, particularly in the\nuncultivated sections.\n» The load-bearing capacity and stability of the soil\nin the uncultivated sections between the rows is\nimproved.\n» Since less soil is cultivated, the loosened strips\nwarm up and dry faster. This carries advantages for\nplant germination and juvenile development.\n» The classic strip-till method requires less tillage\nleading to cost and diesel savings.\n\"Strip-Till” disadvantages\n» Accurate and precise work is required before,\nduring and after this method is carried out. This\nincludes:\n- Very good straw distribution and combine\nharvester chop quality\n- Dry soil conditions\n- A level field without deep ruts/tracks\n- Low pressure on the area to be harvested\n- Management of volunteer grain\n» Precise \"strip-till technology\" required for sowing.\nOnly a few reliable and professional manufacturers\nexist who produce technology suitable for this\nmethod. Most options are customised solutions\nthat suit the farm they are being used on. The\noutput during sowing is considerably lower than\n\"normal\" precision sowing.\n» Mechanical weed control is extremely challenging\ndue to:\n- The high organic mass present\n- Difficulty identifying the main crop and choosing\nthe appropriate intensity (especially when hoeing)\n- Strongly developed and rooted plants between\nrows. Weeding almost impossibleDirect sowing *\nNo tillage or loosening of the soil is required for direct sowing. With this method, the soil is only disturbed to make\na slit for the seed. Since the soil is not turned, direct sowing can be regarded as a particularly extensive form of\nconservation tillage.\n_\nIn contrast to conventional tillage, soil is not worked other than to create seed\nslits for sowing.\nAdvantages of direct sowing\n» Improved water supply and good prevention of soil\nerosion\n» Reduced horizontal displacement of nutrients and\npesticides\n» Good driveability\n» Higher aggregate stability\n» Lower energy and labour requirements\n» Increased acreage performance\n» Lower process costs\nResults: Direct sowing vs. tillage\nDisadvantages of direct sowing\n» Surface drying\n» Delayed surface warming in spring\n» Higher requirements as regards management and\nplant cultivation\n» Use of herbicides may be inevitable\n» Direct sowing is usually only suitable for certain\ncrops, such as winter wheat after winter oilseed rape.

    "7.3 Stubble cultivation": "After the field has been harvested, stubble cultivation is carried out. In addition to managing weeds and undersown\ncrops, harvest residues should be incorporated and the germination of volunteer cereals or weed seeds should be\nencouraged. In dry areas, water evaporation should also be limited.\nStubble cultivation objectives:\n» Loosening the soil\n» Breaking up crusting, mud silting\n» Breaking up superficial areas that are compacted\n» Increasing the pore volume (soil aeration, improved gas and water transfer)\n» Levelling of the field surface (tramline tracks)\n» Stimulating the germination of volunteer cereals and weed seeds\n» Preserving moisture to survive dry conditions\n_\nAims of stubble cultivation:\nloosen the soil, break capillaries, avoid unproductive evaporation.\nMixing in organic matter (harvest residues, compost,\nfarmyard manure, etc.)\n» “Injection” of soil life\n» Encouraging organic matter rotting (disease and\npest prevention)\n» Efficient transformation of organic matter into\nhumus\n» Straw management: When there are high quantities\nof straw, it should be properly chopped beforehand\nso that it can be properly mixed in.\nWeed control\n» Pulling out & cutting weeds\n» Stimulate germination of weed seeds and\nvolunteer seeds from the harvested crop\n» Exposure and drying out root-propagated weed\nroots (couch grass, thistles, etc.)\nRegulating the water balance\n» Avoiding unproductive evaporation in dry\nconditions\n» Encouraging evaporation and soil drying in areas\nthat are too moist\n» Control of animal pathogens (mice and snails)\nStubble cultivation with a focus on interrupting\ncapillaries\nTo prevent moisture loss, capillary action must be\ninterrupted during the first stubble cultivation.\nThis stops moisture from rising through the soil and\nevaporating on the surface after the harvest. Volunteer\ncereals should also be encouraged to grow together\nwith weed seeds so that they can be controlled in the\nsecond stubble cultivation.\nMulch sowing: Once the volunteer cereals have\nemerged, work deeper when sowing using the\nmulch method in order to reduce the topsoil’s\nstraw concentration. This improves the emergence\nconditions for the following crop.Sloping or straight stubble cultivation*\nTake care that crop residue (straw) is spread evenly across the field. To achieve this, we recommend travelling at an\nangle to the combine harvester track. A GPS steering system with lanes saved can be of great use here. CAUTION:\nThis is not beneficial for optimum field levelling. If this is the primary goal, the second stubble cultivation should be\ndriven crossways compared to the first pass so that section can be levelled properly.\nAdvantages of diagonal stubble cultivation\n» The risk of blockages is lower as the tractor is\ndriven at an angle to alleys. This is where there is\noften (too much) straw\n» Straw is distributed more effectively\n» Deep tracks are levelled better\n» This method results in a full-surface cut as the\nsweeps always hit the stubble when travelling at an\nangle. They cannot \"cheat\" their way through.\n» Less tractive force required: Tractive force tests\nhave shown that passes carried out with an inclined\nmachining direction require up to 10 per cent less\ntractive force.\nDisadvantages of diagonal stubble cultivation\n» Instead of working two headlands, a headland must\nbe planned in at all four field boundaries due to the\ndiagonal tillage. This results in more wedges and\ntapered areas. These are time-consuming and must\nbe worked twice. Depending on the field symmetry\nhowever, this might not be too significant.\n» Field levelling may not be sufficient or suitable.\nThis is problematic for subsequent crops and\nmaintenance measures.\nThe first stubble cultivation should be done at a 10-30° angle to the main\ncultivation direction.Practical example: First stubble cultivation before\nmaize, soy, etc.\nAfter harvesting cereals, oilseed rape and peas, etc. in\nsummer, there is often quite a long gap before growing\nthe next main crop (soy, maize, field bean, etc.). This gap\nis generally used for an early stubble cultivation and\na simultaneous catch crop to cover/shade the ground,\nfeed the soil life and promote the active formation of\nhumus and soil. When an early catch crop is grown in\ngood conditions, it quickly establishes dense growth\nand effectively suppresses any weeds or volunteer\ncereals that may germinate. More detail on growing\ncatch crops can be found in the “Growing catch crops”\nsection.\nPractical example: Stubble cultivation with a focus\non weed control\nOnce a cereal crop has been harvested, the ground\nshould be tilled as soon as possible and as shallow\nas possible to encourage volunteer cereals and weed\nseeds to germinate. Multiple passes with a cultivator at\nvarious depths and at intervals of several days reduces\nthe prevalence of weeds. However, this conflicts with\nearly catch crop sowing and rapid soil cover. Depending\non the summer and the weed pressure, either a weed\ntreatment should be carried out or a catch crop should\nbe sown as early as possible. Volunteer cereals can\nusually be suppressed fairly reliably by using a bulky\ncover crop mix. Otherwise, they make a perfectly good\nenhancement to a cover crop mix once they have\ngerminated.Practical example: \"Weed treatment\" as an emergency measure\nWindows of time between main crops can be used to\ntreat weeds in fields with strong weed pressure, and\nespecially those with acute root-propagated weed\nproblems. At this point, we should mention that it\nis important to analyse and eliminate the causes of\nwidespread weed occurrence. A weed treatment is, to a\ngreater or lesser extent, an emergency measure, which\nprimarily combats symptoms, without eliminating the\nactual causes long term (e.g. nitrate leaching into the\nsubsoil, soil compaction, imbalance nutrient levels).\nWhen focussing on weed control, the first stubble\ncultivation should be carried out as shallow as possible\n(approx. 4-5 cm / 1.60-2\") with a flat cultivator,\nfor example. This will encourage weed seeds and\nvolunteer cereals to germinate. Further, the soil should\nbe penetrated at full width (to control root-propagated\nweeds). When dealing with root-propagated weeds\nespecially, intensive reconsolidation has a negative\neffect since residual weeds that are pressed down can\noften sprout again and even propagate. For this reason,\na lightweight trailing unit, such as a bar roller should\nbe used in combination with a tined weeder. The tined\nweeder brings the weeds to the surface and loosens\nthe residual soil from the roots. As a result, weeds\ndry out faster. To successfully treat root-propagated\nweeds, a few days of dry weather (hot, dry air, wind)\nare required.\n_\n\"Weed treatments\" only tackle the symptoms - it is therefore a reactive\nmeasure, rather than an active way to deal with weeds.Practical example: Stubble cultivation with a focus on weed control and capillarity\nOn the second pass, the working depth should be\nThe roots of root weeds should be laid out in dry\nincreased to approx. 10 cm (3.90\") to destroy any\nweather to weaken the root weeds long term.

In doing so, it is important that only\ntime. After a weed treatment, a dense catch crop\ndry soil horizons are cultivated. Patches of smearing\nshould be established immediately in order to bind the\nand slades should certainly be avoided, otherwise soil\nnutrients released through intensive cultivation and\npores close up interrupting groundwater movement.\nto stabilise the soil structure. (see section “Growing\ncatch crops”).\nOverlapping of the duckfoot sweeps = full-surface cutting during stubble\ncultivation.Stubble cultivation: The TOP 10\n1\nThe primary objectives for stubble cultivation should be defined before the harvest.\n2\nSet the combine correctly (straw distribution, mowing height, wastage, chop length).\n3\nSpread stubble cultivation over 2 passes: The first pass should be as flat as possible (up to 5 cm / 2\").\nThe working depth should be increased for the second pass.\n4\nWork the entire soil surface - no unworked sections (bridges) should remain.\n5\nGood mixing of organic matter with soil.\n6\nCultivate at an angle - up to 30°.\n7\nUse the trailing rollers for uncovering (uprooting) roots and reconsolidation.\n8\nInterrupt capillaries to prevent moisture loss.\n9\n\"Weed treatment\" or timely catch crop seeding.\n10\nEnsure ideal weather conditions: make use of dry conditions to dry weed roots on the soil surface.\nDuckfoot sweeps require a slight undercut and a clear cutting edge to work at\ntheir best.\nA spade soil sample will help you decide the right tool and correct working\ndepth.An overview of Einböck technology for stubble cultivation: Universal cultivator HURRICANE\nThe extremely user-friendly universal cultivator\nHURRICANE combines three types of machinery in one.\nThe HURRICANE is the ideal tool for stubble cultivation\nand the incorporation of cover crops. It also shows its\nstrengths when breaking up compaction in deeper\nlayers of the soil.\nThe working depth can be adjusted between 4 beams,\nwith a 20 cm (7.90\") line spacing between 4 and 25 cm\n(1.60 and 9.80\") (depending on the sweep equipment,\ntrailing unit and soil conditions). Operation over the\nfull surface can be achieved by choosing the correct\nsweeps. After tillage, the soil surface is levelled and\nreconsolidated. The HURRICANE is an extremely\ncompact and manoeuvrable tool that can be used\neffectively on small and large areas. A seeder for sowing\ncatch crops can be easily mounted and adjusted.\nThe HURRICANE is suitable for:\n» Catch crop ploughing\n» Stubble cultivation\n» Basic soil cultivation\nThe powerful all-rounder HURRICANE works down to 25 cm (9.80\").\nCultivator TAIFUN\nThe TAIFUN light cultivator is designed for shallow\ncutting with duckfoot sweeps, and with a line spacing\nof 15 cm (5.90\"). It is the perfect tool for successful\nfirst mechanical weed control.

    "7.4 Seedbed preparation": "For optimum seed placement, good conditions should\nencourage seed germination and, above all, ensure\neven emergence. Rapid water absorption is key. A\nsoil density that steadily increases from bottom to\ntop allows seed roots to penetrate the soil deeply\nand means water is easily accessible rapid seed\ngermination.\nYou will require suitable technology to ensure the\nseedbed can be prepared for sowing up to a good\nstandard in a single pass. The preparation of a\nsuitable seedbed to create favourable conditions for\nsubsequent maintenance measures is another key\nrequirement. The main aim is to eliminate weeds.\n_\nA key consideration in seedbed preparation: creating good conditions for tined\nweeder and hoe usage.\nSeedbed preparation objectives\nSeedbed combinations and seedbed cultivators create\nthe right ratio between fine and coarse soil, which\ncounteracts crusting and evaporation. It is important\nto disturb the soil as little as possible when preparing\nthe seedbed to retain as much moisture as possible\nwithin the soil. Coarse soil is moved to the top, fine\nsoil remains on the sowing horizon. The correct trailing\nunits (rollers) and front levelling plates are particularly\nimportant.\nSince every farm has a different field soil composition,\nthe correct choice of tools is essential to achieve the\nbest results. To enable seed to be precisely distributed\nat a later date, seedbed preparation requires a smooth-\nrunning tool that exactly maintains the working depth\nset. In organic farming, when preparing the seedbed\nand sowing, it is particularly important to ensure that\nafter sowing, the surface is sufficiently even for the\ntools (tined weeder, hoe, etc.) to work to the same\ndepth in all areas.Features of an optimal seedbed\nA perfectly levelled, shallow-cultivated seedbed is\ncharacterised by a medium to coarse tilth with an\nopen structure. The seed itself is placed into a fine-\ntilth soil horizon with a compacted, water-bearing\nlayer underneath. To avoid damaging the soil through\ncompression, seedbed preparation should be carried\nout in as few passes as possible. As far as possible,\nthe field should not be driven over when soaked. The\nresulting compacted areas and crusting delay the\ndevelopment of plants.\n_\nAs a general rule: As rough as possible and as fine as necessary.\n\"False seedbed\" in spring\nIf the conditions in spring permit, a “false seedbed”\ncan also be prepared. Seeds from weeds can germinate\nand start to grow in seedbeds that have been prepared\n2 to 4 weeks before sowing is planned. These weeds\ncan then be tackled relatively easily and effectively\nduring actual seedbed preparation before sowing. To\nintensify this effect, the “false seedbed” , can also\nFalse seedbeds: an effective way to reduce weed pressure\nbe cultivated flat once or twice in between using a\nseedbed combination, or possibly also a tined weeder.\nThis enables weed pressure to be distinctly reduced\nparticularly during the early stages of the main crop.An overview of Einböck technology for seedbed preparation\nEXTREM seedbed preparation\nThe EXTREM seedbed combination has been developed\nfor seedbed preparation on all types of soil, especially\nploughed land. The perfect combination of fine and\ncoarse soil particles creates structures that prevent\ncrusting. The specification of the tine sections and\nrear rollers, which is designed to meet the customer's\nsoil conditions, ensures ideal depth control. This\ncreates the perfect seed horizon, which forms the\nbasis for optimum seed emergence. Also in heavy\nsoil conditions, a level surface and a fine seedbed are\nensured.\nFine cultivator VIBROSTAR\nThe VIBROSTAR seedbed cultivator is designed for\nprofessional and user-friendly seedbed preparation.\nIt is mainly used for light to medium-heavy soils.\nThe light cultivator creates the perfect seedbed and\nensures optimum levelling on ploughed or mulch\nseeded fields with organic matter. The special design\nof the frame and the high-quality spring tines which\nare mounted to the frame with a line spacing of 10\ncm (3.90\") ensure intensive soil mixing with excellent\nsoil flow. This ensures the machine can handle a high\namount of residue without getting blocked.\nDepending on the field conditions and cultivation\nobjective, the cultivator is available with 4 or 5 row\ntine arrangement, tines with various different shapes\nand lengths as well as an alternative trailed weeder.\nThe version with 4-row frame is also available with a\nfront roller.\n_The larger the seed, the coarser the seedbed!Avoid PTO-driven (Power Take-Off) devices\nPTO-driven implements such as power harrows and\nrotary hillers should be avoided as much as possible\nsince they can smear soil in wet conditions. They\nalso run the risk of breaking up the different soil\ncomponents too intensively. When they are used in\nspring, after the field has been ploughed in autumn,\nthe seedbed can quickly become too fine tending to\ncause crusting and erosion.\nCompared to actively driven seedbed preparation\ntools, passive tools (such as fine and universal\ncultivators) have a lower power requirement per metre\nof working width. In combination with the higher\nworking speeds that these devices enable, the area\noutput can be greatly increased. This can increase the\neconomic utilisation of the machine, especially during\nshort periods of good weather in spring, when a large\narea needs to be processed in a very short period of\ntime.\nSeedbed preparation: The TOP 5\n1\nPrepare a precise seedbed: The measures that are carried out before sowing are critical. A precise and,\nabove all, even seedbed is a fundamental requirement for a weed-free field. The seed should be sown on\na level soil surface with few tracks. Rolling before or after sowing can be beneficial.\n2\nPay attention to the correct working depth: A uniform, deep seed horizon is essential for uniform\nemergence. During seedbed preparation, take care not to work too shallow, and certainly not too deep. A\nsuitable ratio of fine to coarse soil is another prerequisite.\n3\nCreate a false seedbed: Whenever possible, prepare a false seedbed, as this encourages the first wave of\nweed seeds to germinate, meaning you can eliminate them before seed sowing.\n4\nChop up organic matter & distribute evenly\n5\nCoordinate technology: Tractor - seedbed preparation technology - seed drill"

    "10.1 What to expect from the tined weeder": "The success of a tined weeder in controlling weeds\nis primarily accomplished by burying the weeds in\nsoil at the cotyledon stage (50–70%) in addition to\npulling the weeds out of the ground (30–50%). When\nyou increase the speed, larger weeds can be buried.\nHowever, this comes with the possible risk of harming\nthe crop. To use the tined weeder to its full potential,\nyou must select the right setting and the right time to\nuse it.\nSince the main goal in weeding is not to pull out, but\nto bury; exposing small weeds is essential. This is why\nthe early weed filament to cotyledon stage should\nbe targeted. For example, black grass, windthale and\nwhite goosefoot can be effectively controlled up to the\ncotyledon stage. Once the weeds have outgrown this\nstage and have grown one or two pairs of leaves, the\nburying effect of the weeder decreases significantly,\nand the tine aggressiveness must be readjusted.\n_\nWhen weeding, 50-70% of weeds are buried, and 30-50% are pulled out.\n_\nIf the weeds are deeply rooted or are larger than the main crop, the tined\nweeder will not be able to remove them.In weeding technology, a fundamental distinction\nis made between direct and indirect spring-loaded\nsystems.

Tines can be set to aggressively \"tipped\nforward\" for effective weed control, then reset to\n\"dragging\" for gentle applications. To achieve the best\nresults, we recommend setting the tines to a gentle\n“grip”, preferably at a low to medium tine pressure.\nThis ensures soil is well aerated and protects the crop\nfrom any potential harm. The best results are achieved\nwhen the tines are set to a medium “grip”. They will\nthen effectively remove weeds, uproot weed roots and\n\"dance\" around the rows of plants.\nWhen you adjust the tine position (tine aggressiveness) significantly, make sure\nyou also adjust the feeler wheels.Feeler wheels\nThe front and rear feeler wheels must be adjusted to\nensure the weeder is level with the ground. The front\nrow of tines should be set to the same working depth as\nthe rear row. This ensures precise depth control. This is\nextremely important, particularly when blind weeding\nas you want to avoid damaging delicate seedlings. The\nrear feeler wheels also ensure precise depth control,\nas the tines at the front and rear are guided to a precise\ndepth on uneven ground.\nIf the weeder has a chassis or wheels at the rear, it must be driven using the\nupper link in the slotted hole.\nWorking speed\nWorking speed has a big influence on intensity – adjust\nthis based on the conditions, crop and weed pressure.\nThe faster you travel with the tined weeder, the greater\nits performance power and success in controlling\nweeds. Be mindful that travelling at higher speeds\nposes a greater risk to the crop. It is important to find\nthe right balance here.

    "10.5 Weeding out in the field": "Blind weeding is one of the most important weeding\npasses, and is carried out between seed sowing and\ncrop emergence. Deeper seed placement ensures\nthat the seedlings are not damaged. Notably, the\nbest success with weed control is achieved in the\ntube stage at up to 80%. As well as helping to control\nweeds, blind weeding also breaks open the soil crust,\nenabling a better crop emergence.\nBlind weeding in spring is very beneficial to crops,\nas weeds are controlled at an early (filamentous)\nstage. This is perfect for summer crops such as oats,\nbeans like field beans and soy beans, maize, pumpkin,\nsunflowers, potatoes, peas, etc.\n_\nBlind weeding is carried out between seed sowing and crop emergence.\nWhen to carry out blind weeding:\n» Shortly before the crop “breaks through”, e.g. the tips in cereals\nCarry out blind weeding as late as your main crop allows.\nThe correct way to carry out blind weeding:\n» Tined weeders \"drag\" at approx. 90° to the soil surface\n» Tine pressure should enable a suitable working depth (e.g. 2-3 cm / 0.80-1.2\").

Farmers should record their own practical experiences to get the best results\nfor the specific conditions on their farm.\nEinböck: The Organic Farming Handbook\n6 9\nWeeding after crop emergence\nIn principle, weed structure and soil structure (e.g.\nincrustations) determine when to weed cereals, grain\nlegumes, maize and potatoes. Once the crop has\nemerged, the ground should be weeded to bury the\nweeds in the soil as long as possible, i.e. when the\nweeds are no further on than the cotyledon stage\n(tube stage).\nAvoid weeding during the crop's delicate growth stages, e.g. cereals in the\n2-leaf stage).\nAdjustment during weeding after emergence\nIt is important you do not set the tined weeder to be\ntoo aggressive. Most crops are still sensitive to being\nburied at this stage, so the soil should be disturbed as\nlittle as possible.\n» Set tines to “tip forward”: less soil will be\ndisturbed and weeds will be uprooted more easily\n» Delicate crops: to avoid burial of crops, the tine\nend must be set at an angle of 30°-40° to the soil\nsurface. Low tine pressure will prevent deep soil\npenetration.\n» Robust crops: Select a tine angle of 50° - 70° for\nrobust crops. This will move more soil. A stronger\ntine pressure can also be used to penetrate deeper\ninto the soil (e.g. for soy)Adjustment when the weed is beyond the cotyledon stage\nIf the weeds have passed beyond the cotyledon stage,\ncontrolling them is harder. Weeding must be carried\nout more intensively (more tine pressure or a stiffer\ntine setting) because it will barely be possible to pull\nthe weeds out.

  "11. ROTARY HOE BASICS": {
    "11.1 Using the rotary hoe": "Rotary hoes break up incrustations and allow air and\nwater to penetrate the soil. Particularly in regions\nwith heavy rainfall, rotary hoes ensure plants are\nencouraged to grow. In addition to breaking up crusts,\nrotary hoes also control weeds in the same pass. The\nrotary hoe can even replace hoeing if carried out early\nenough. Generally though, it is an important addition\nas a shared machine to organic and Fusion Farming\noperations and contractors.\nThe rotary hoe works very simply:\nThe rotor stars break up incrustations with their rotor\nblades, ensuring soil aeration. They throw up soil with\ntheir spoon-shaped star tips and uproot weeds at the\nfilament stage. They deposit the weeds on the soil\nsurface where they then dry out.\nThe rotary hoe is perfect for breaking the soil crust and aerating soil. It also\nuproots and buries weeds. Wide time windows and high working speed\nThe high working speed of the rotary hoe is one of its\nbiggest advantages. It can work up to 20 km/h, resulting\nin a high hectare output. The wider time window than\nusual also makes the rotary hoe very popular and\nextremely practical in conventional agriculture. The\ntool’s \"spooning\" method means that work can be\ncarried out if the soil is moist and can be driven over,\nand this is earlier than when weeding or hoeing.\n_\nThe hectare output of a rotary hoe is extremely high as it can operate at speeds\nof up to 20 km/h.\nEarlier operation post rain\nThe rotary hoe produces a crumbly surface, meaning\nthe weeder can be used 1-2 days later with extremely\neffective results. Ideally, the rotary hoe should be used\nas soon as possible after rain. The drier the soil, the less\neffective the tool and the less breaking up of crust is\npossible. Using the rotary hoe half a day earlier or later\ncan make a big difference (e.g. morning vs. evening).\nPlan in a rotary hoe pass before a weeding pass!\nThe rotary hoe can \"pre-loosen\" soil so that a subsequent rotative weeder pass\ncan be more effective and aggressive.",

Grids are also cutted into all holders for\neasier depth adjustment. The extremely wear-resistant\nduckfoot sweeps can be easily screwed in from the\nback. This results in a secure and rigid hold, while\nensuring they can be replaced quickly and easily.\n_\nThe Special Vibro-tine is Einböck's best-selling tine and comes highly\nrecommended.\nEinböck's special ultra-flat sweeps (image 3):\nThe Einböck special ultra-flat sweep produces a\nprecise and clean cut at the minimum working depth.\nThe extra-flat duckfoot sweeps ensure a safe cutting\naction, saving as much valuable capillary water as\npossible. The horizontal position of the sweep allows\nyou to work at higher speeds without throwing up soil.\nThis makes it ideal for narrow row spacings (up to 30\ncm / 11.80\") in particular, as the crop is not buried.\nRecommended for use when hoeing cereals or small crops which may not be\nburied (e.g. beetroot).\nCarbide metal sweeps (image 2+5)\nSpecial base sweeps can be fitted with carbide tips\nor plates, then coated.

The weeds here are still in the juvenile stage and\nare buried or pulled out and dried on the soil surface.\nPrecise adjustment of these weeders is crucial for\nsuccess and to avoid damaging the main crop.\nSimilar to finger weeders, the trailed rotative weeder\nprocesses a row’s unhoed band. The rotating stars\n\"comb\" weeds out of the row. The trailed-rotative\nweeder is used in mulch-till and fields with organic\nmatter, because it works without clogging. The trailed\nrotative weeder carries certain advantages over finger\nweeders when used on slopes, as it does not have\nto work directly above the row due to its inclined\nposition, while still producing an effect right next to\nit. The holder on which the rotative weed element is\nmounted is the same as that of the finger weeder. Both\ntools can therefore be exchanged easily.\nA trailed rotative weeder can operate more aggressively than a finger weeder.",

    "13.8 Hoeing out in the field": "» Sowing: As a general rule: Number of rows sown\n= number of rows hoed. Your row-crop cultivator\nmust always be perfectly attuned to your seeder.\nThe number of rows on the seed drill dictates the\nnumber of rows on the row-crop cultivator (half\nwidths are also possible).\n» Row spacing: The row spacing on the row-\ncrop cultivator must be identical to that of the\nsowing machine. Sowing your seed precisely and\naccurately sets you up for success later on when\nhoeing. If the row spacing varies at this stage,\nit is difficult if not impossible to work with any\nprecision at the hoeing stage.\n» Headland: The headland is hoed initially, and if\nnecessary, once more at the end. This is because\nhoed-out weeds can become pressed down by the\ntractor tyres.\n» Timing: Start as early as possible - if weeds are\nalready clearly visible, it is already too late\n» Frequency: Avoid too frequent hoeing as this\ncauses more weeds to germinate, damages the crop\nand \"disturbs\" the soil structure. Better to hoe at\nthe right time (too early), than twice at the wrong\ntime (too late).\n» Time of day: Midday is the right time for hoeing.\nThere should ideally be no rain forecast after you\nhave hoed.\n» Close working for high weed control: Work as\nclose as possible to the crop row (= narrow unhoed\nband) as this will ensure successful weed control.\nHoe as early as possible - the later you hoe, the more the weeds will compete\nwith your crops for water, light and nutrients.",
    "13.9 Row-crop cultivator configuration": "Setting up your row-crop cultivator correctly is critical for a successful hoeing pass and therefore for your harvest.\nAllow yourself enough time to set up your hoeing technology correctly and professionally.\nAdjustments when mounting a row-crop cultivator on a tractor\n» Lower links: Height levelling of the lower links\nis optional for you to achieve better ground\nadaptation (for upper link steering and camera\nsteering). The lower link struts must be the same\nlength.\n» Row-crop cultivator without camera steering\nsystem: When mounting a row-crop cultivator\nwith high-gauge wheel steering (without camera\nsteering), the side lower link stabilisers must be\nopened so that they can move side to side. If not,\nthe row-crop cultivator cannot follow the tractor\nproperly and the tool will soon end up alongside\nthe track.\n» Row-crop cultivator with camera steering system:\nWhen mounting a row-crop cultivator without\nhigh-gauge wheel steering (with camera steering),\nthe side lower link stabilisers must be closed so\nthat they cannot move side to side. In addition,\nthe ball in the lower link bracket must be rigidly\nmounted. Distances may help in this situation. If\nthe sideshift frame is not mounted rigidly onto\nthe tractor, it creates a lot of play. If this happens,\nthere is a danger of the row-crop cultivator not\nmoving in line with the crop rows, since it can move\nin another direction on the lower links at the front\n(i.e. it will oversteer). Due to the large amount of\nplay, the sideshift movement cannot be directly\ntransferred to the row-crop cultivator, which delays\ncourse correction and greatly impairs precision.\n» Upper link: The upper link should be set up so that\nthe machine is level during operation. A hydraulic\nupper link is best suited to this. If the machine is\nnot set up level, the sweeps will not all work at the\nsame working depth. This can lead to the machine\nnot operating at full width. The hoeing sections\nshould be set parallel to the ground (or sloping to\nthe rear slightly).(Pre-)adjust the row-crop cultivator in advance while on your farm and in peace\nand quiet. This will save you from unnecessary and stressful adjustment out in\nthe field under the hot midday sun!Working depth and tool adjustments\n» As deep as necessary- yet as shallow as possible: The working depth should ensure that the sweeps cut through\nthe entire surface of the soil - however, go no deeper. If cultivation is too deep, a lot of moist soil will be brought\nto the surface. Excessive earth movement increases the risk of erosion and water loss. Furthermore, a large\nquantity of new weed seeds are brought to the surface which have the potential to germinate. This can cause\nweeds to regerminate faster and crops to lose out on vital moisture.\nOn ground that is prone to erosion, a small trench with larger clods can be formed in the middle of the row by\nsetting the last tine on each element lower. This should prevent shallow undercut earth from being washed\naway from hillside fields.\n» Full-surface cut: Weeds should be cut across the whole area and allowed to dry on the soil surface. To guarantee\nyour tool is working at full width, sweeps must overlap slightly. Use the spindle to quickly adjust each element\nto the correct working depth - in practice, this is 2-4 cm (0.80-1.60\").\n» Select the correct tool: Depending on the soil type and conditions (e.g. presence of stones, organic matter, etc.),\nsweeps of different widths can be fitted to align with row spacing. Depending on the crop and purpose of use,\nvarious heaping sweeps, angle knives, ultra-flat duckfoot sweeps and trailed working tools can also be used.\nThis is where it is important to choose the tool best suited adapted to the conditions.\n» Parallelogram: Adjust the retraction spring to the ground conditions so that the parallelogram works smoothly\nand precisely.\nW\nThe row-crop cultivator can be adapted to the following crop as early as winter.\nThe working depth and cutting setting should be checked multiple times while\nworking.Parallelogram and hoeing section adjustments\n» Set sweeps to the size of your crop: The smaller\nthe plants, the closer they should be hoed (unhoed\nband). The aim is to get the sweeps as close as\npossible to the crop without covering it with soil.\nThe larger the plants, the further away the sweeps\nmust be so as not to damage the roots and or\nassimilation surfaces.\n» Align the parallelogram exactly: When in the\nworking position, the parallelogram should be\nparallel or slightly inclined to the floor. This\nenables the retraction spring of the hoeing\nparallelogram to be preloaded and guarantees\nhoe sweep penetration, even on heavily crusted\nsoils. In this position, the parallelogram also has\nthe largest amount of scope to adjust upwards and\ndownwards.\nA 3-stage adjustable retraction spring ensures that the parallelogram can put\nincreased pressure on the ground.\nCrop protection element adjustments\n» Adjust element depth: The smaller the plants, the\ndeeper the protection elements must be set so that\nplants are not buried or damaged.\n» Simple folding: Shortly before the crop canopies,\nthe protection elements are unnecessary and can\nsimply be lifted up out of the way.\n» Types of protective elements: The type of\nprotection required (e.g. crop deflector shield\nor disc) once more depends on the crop and soil\nconditions (e.g. organic matter or large amounts of\nstones).\nMost legumes such as soy and field beans are not weakened when covered with\nsoil and while still small. No protection elements are therefore required in these\ncircumstances.\nOnce a crop is well established, protection elements\nare no longer needed at all. Faster working speeds and\nvarious ridging tools are used at later stages to shift\nsome earth into the row. This encourages the soil over\nthe plant roots to warm up by creating a larger surface\narea, thus guaranteeing faster growth. Furthermore,\nsmall weeds within the row are covered with soil,\nalleviating some of the weed pressure.\nNo protection elements are needed for well-developed stands!Finger weeder adjustments\n» Adjust finger distances precisely: Fingers should be set approx. 2 cm (0.80\") apart. 2 cm (0.80\") spacing is only\npossible in practice, however, when a camera steering system is fitted at the rear. If machinery does not have\ncamera steering, it is virtually impossible to detect 2 cm (0.80\") with the naked eye, making this setting nigh on\nimpossible. If the cultivated crop has already grown a little, the finger weeder should be set further apart as the\ncrop plants and their roots will be thicker.\n» Light pressure for ideal adjustment: The fingers of the plastic stars should all bend slightly upwards, i.e. light\npressure should be applied. Springs on the finger weeder arm should be slightly under pressure when driving.\nThis will allow the fingers to work properly and adapt well to uneven ground. The pressure can be adjusted by\naltering the height of the finger weeder holders. Springs also compensate for any weeder frame movements\nthat may be caused by support wheels or feeler wheels.\n» Set the depth: The steel weeder fingers penetrate the soil and work to an appropriate depth (not too deep, but\nnot too shallow either), according to the soil composition, soil type and crop stage. Adjust the finger weeder so\nthat it operates at a shallow depth. It is important that it does not go too deep.\nFinger weeders must work independently of leading tools.\nIt is important to use a separate bracket for each\nindividual row of crops, on which each pair of stars\nis mounted. When stars are mounted directly on the\nhoeing element without their own parallelogram,\nthey work at different heights. This results in one-\nsided pressure on the row of plants. The finger weeder\nshould also work a row parallel and without offset.\nThis is the only way to ensure precise work that avoids\nharming the crop. When finger weeders are staggered\nin relation to the row-crop cultivator frame they can\ndamage the crop, operate at different heights and shift\nor damage the rows of plants. Weed control is also\nthen limited as the fingers do not work simultaneously\non the left and right of the row.\nFinger weeders must work parallel to each other.Trailed rotative weeder adjustments\n» Working speed: The faster you drive, the more aggressive the work.\n» Down pressure: Down pressure can be set from “floating” to “heavily spring-loaded”. The higher the down\npressure, the more intensive the mode of operation.\n» Tine angle: Great care must be taken in this respect as crops can be entirely severed if the setting is sharp.\nTo achieve the right level of aggressiveness, control\nthe working speed, and down pressure and angle of\nthe rotor star sweeps. The perfect combination of\nthese three parameters is vital in order not to damage\nthe crop, while still maximising the weed control.\nRotative weeders are more aggressive than finger weeders.",

In addition to controlling weeds, this process also stimulates tillering.The final weeding pass: Before the crop is closing its rows, you can work fairly intensively and with high\npressure on the tined section.",
    "14.2 Winter cereals": "To avoid disease within your crop rotation, the usual\nrules and cultivation breaks apply as set out in the\n\"Crop rotation\" section. In addition, the proportion of\ncereals should not exceed 50% of the land set aside\nfor crop rotation, otherwise the risk of disease and\nproblem weeds will increase. With frequent cultivation\nof winter cereals, autumn-germinating weeds such as\ncleaver, windthale, camomile and root weeds such\nas dock and thistle increase rapidly due to the long\ngrowing period. In this case, weeding success depends\non starting well before winter, and weeding in autumn.\nW\nSequence based on demands of the preceding crop:\nWinter barley – winter wheat – triticale – spelt – ryeSowing\nWinter cereals must be sown in good time so that\nthe first weeding can be completed in autumn. Plant\nwinter barley, triticale and rye before the end of the\ngrowing season and winter wheat and spelt will then\nideally overwinter in the 3-leaf stage.\nUndersown crops\nRead about the advantages of undersown crops in\nthe section \"Undersown crops\". In cereals, undersown\ncrops are particularly useful during the advanced\nstages. This is when leaves shrink and more light falls\non the ground once more allowing undersown crops to\nform valuable organic green matter and roots in just\na few weeks. For cereals, undersown crops should be\nsown between tillering and cereal shooting, i.e. after\nthe second weeding pass. The undersown seeds will\nquickly grow if fine weeding is carried out between the\nrows of seeds.\nThe issue of cleaver\nCleaver can cause a lot of damage, especially to cereal\ncrops. This is mainly down to the competition they\ncreate for nitrogen in the soil, light and water. Cleaver\nattaches to crops and pushes them to the ground,\nmaking harvesting more difficult and increasing the\nmoisture content of the crop. The damage threshold is\nas low as 0.1 plants/square metre.\nCleaver can be effectively controlled with a tined\nweeder while it is in in the very early germination\nto 2-leaf stages. If weeding is not possible at this\nstage (due to plant cultivation or weather conditions)\nlarger cleaver plants can also be \"combed out\" later.\nCleaver branches out as it grows causing it to become\nentangled in weeders and meaning it can be \"combed\nout\".\nWeeder tines are tipped forward and do not touch the ground. Raise and clear\nthe tined weeder at the edge of fields.Do NOT comb out when ear emergence first starts in cleaver and vetches as\nstalks will snap easily at this stage.Mechanical weed control of winter cereals using the tined weeder\nIn autumn (depending on climate, soil moisture,\nweather, etc.)\nBlind weeding: Blind weeding in autumn is often\ntricky and sometimes impossible due to the weather\nat this time of year. We suggest a guideline of 2-5 days\nafter sowing - in suitable weather conditions. Above\nall, sensitivity is required: work should be carried out\ncarefully so that the grain seedling is not damaged. Set\na low tine pressure, depending on the soil and weather\nconditions.\nAggressiveness: gentle to moderate\nWeeding after emergence: Roots are already well\ndeveloped when the grain reaches the 2- to 3-leaf\nstage in autumn. Weather permitting, tines must work\nslowly across the field in a moderate to aggressive\nsetting. Tine penetration can be relatively stronger\nthan when blind weeding - once more, depending on\nthe soil and weather conditions. Weed pressure will\ndetermine whether weeding is necessary. Usually\nhowever, weeding is required in the 3-leaf stage as\na minimum. In addition to controlling weeds, this\nencourages tillering, and the humus is loosened and\naerated.\nAggressiveness: moderate (rotative weeder tine\npressure: soft)\nDuring persistently wet weather in autumn, the tined weeder cannot be operated; instead the rotary hoe can be\nused. This aerates the soil and breaks the soil crust. The rotary hoe can be used during higher soil moisture levels\nthan the tined weeder.\nTined weeding is not always possible in autumn due to the weather.In spring\nTined weeding with moderate aggressiveness: Tined\nweeding must be carried out as early as possible in the\nspring. Tillering should be stimulated as soon as the\nfrost abates, and the soil dries out. A tined weeding\npass carries a number of advantages: By breaking up\nthe crust in the spring, soil is aerated and warms up\nfaster. Vegetation can therefore start more rapidly,\nstalks grow stronger, and tillering is stimulated.\nAggressiveness: gentle to moderate on soil and plants\nIf the soil is extremely hard and crusted, a rotary hoe pass is advisable before\ntined weeding. The soil tilth is then suitable for tined weeding.\nBe patient in spring - conditions should be dry before doing the first tined\nweeder pass.\nTined weeding at approx. 30–40 cm (11.80-15.70\")\nplant height: After the first weeding pass in spring,\ntined weeding can be carried out whenever required\n- up to a plant height of 30-40 cm (11.80-15.70\"). At\nthis point, nutrients are mobilised once more, late\nweed germination is prevented, and balanced growth\nconditions exist for plants and micro-organisms.Do not weed when it is frosty!\nIt is essential that no late frosts occur in the days\nfollowing a tined weeding pass in spring. Weeding\nreduces frost hardiness as these measures increase the\ncrop's sensitivity to the cold, therefore do not carry out\ntined weeding if there is a risk of frost during the night.\nAs a general rule: 3 days afterwards no frost - 10-14\ndays afterwards growth phaseWith the rotary hoe\n» In winter cereals: In spring once there are no more night frosts.

Other than this, used of the tined weeder must be limited, as this plant is very sensitive.\nBlind weeding and careful use of the tined weeder is possible from the 3-leaf stage. Buckwheat is highly competitive\nagainst weeds. Due to its lost seeds and dormancy, buckwheat can itself act as a weed.\nOrganic rye\non.\nRye suppresses weeds well. It can be blind weeded in autumn. After this, weeding is possible from the 3-4 leaf stage\nOrganic summer oats\nthe 4-leaf stage.\nBlind weeding is useful to reduce weed pressure (as with most crops).

Under favourable growing conditions, the crop\ndevelops quickly and suppresses weeds effectively. Afterwards, spring wheat can be weeded from the three-leaf\nstage. A weeding pass can also be carried out before shooting - depending on the weed pressure.\nOrganic spring barley\nBarley does not have much resistance to weeds. Seedbeds that are as weed-free as possible are beneficial to this\ncrop. Spring barely is quite sensitive to the weeder, even during the 3-leaf stage, therefore weeding is only carried\nout again during tillering. In general, vigorous, and long-stemmed spring barley varieties suppress weeds better.",
    "14.3 Mechanical weed control with the row-crop cultivator": "Sowing\nThe correct row spacing must be defined at the time of\nsowing when hoeing cereals. 25-30 cm (9.80-11.80\")\nis ideal. If the spacing is narrower, only a short pass\nwith a row-crop cultivator with camera steering is\npossible due to the row closing sooner. If the spacing is\nwider, e.g. 37.5 cm (14.80\") or above, the row does not\ncover by the end of growing and late weed infestation\nis a risk. At 25-30 cm (9.80-11.80\"), you have the\nadvantage of increased tillering and lighter weed\ncontrol, yet the row spacing is still narrow enough to\nallow the row to cover.\n1. 2. First hoeing pass: These should be carried out\nfrom the 4-leaf stage. For this reason, we advise\nweeding the cereal first (blind, if necessary) to\ncapture weeds in the rows.\nAdditional hoeing passes: The second and third\nhoe passes (if necessary) can be carried out up to\nthe point the row is covered or ears emerge.\nLate hoeing of cereals mobilises up to 15kg N/ha!To avoid hilling the cereal crop too much and/or moving too much earth in\nnarrower row spacings, you should use the shallowest sweeps possible (ultra\nflat sweeps).Individually guided sweeps adapt to the soil much better and as a result, main\nthe working depth more consistently.Advantages & disadvantages of growing cereals in wide rows\nAdvantages:\n» High level of nitrogen mobilisation: Hoeing, with\nits deeper and more extensive soil disturbance\ncompared to weeding, supports a higher degree of\nnitrogen mobilization.\n» Better/simpler weed control: Using the tined\nweeder and hoe in combination results in better\nweed control. Tined weeders tackle large weeds\nand hoes are most effective for root weeds.\nProblem areas in rows can therefore also be sown\nwhile achieving a virtually weed-free field.\n» Hard crusts are broken up: With winter cereals,\nit is often too late to try and break up heavily\ncrusted soils in the spring using a tined weeder.\nBy breaking up the crust in the spring, the soil is\naerated and warms up faster. As a result, the crop\ncan start growing faster. This is also possible with\nthe tined weeder, but if the crust is extremely\nhard, it will probably require several passes to\nachieve the same effect. The best solution in these\nconditions is the rotary hoe.\n» Water is saved: Interrupting the capillary effect\nprevents unproductive evaporation.\n» Reduction in sowing costs: Wider rows mean up\nto 30 % less seed is required per hectare, thus\nreducing costs.\n» Dense stocks: Tillering of crops is markedly\nimproved since each individual plant is exposed to\nmore light.\n» Stronger crop: Improved tillering means that each\nplant forms more leaves. This can lead to the crop\nassimilating for longer. As a result of extended\ngrowing, the grains generally grow bigger, and\nthe protein content is increased. In addition, the\nprotein content is increased as a result of soil\nmineralisation during hoeing.\nDisadvantages:\n» Potentially lower yield\n» Increased weed pressure due to less soil shading",

  "15. MECHANICAL WEED CONTROL IN MAIZE": {"15": "As a root crop, maize provides a welcome break amongst\na cereal-heavy crop rotation, as well as a simple solution\nfor managing root-propagated weeds. Maize consumes\nnutrients and is not highly competitive with weeds in\nits early stages. When the seedling is about to break\nthrough and emerge out of the soil's surface, this crop is\nvery sensitive. Weeding should be avoided during this\nstage. From the 1-leaf stage (BBCH 11), the seedling\nis more robust, and weeds can be controlled with low\nspeed passes. Maize is late to cover soil, so weeders and\nhoes must be used very precisely. This crop therefore\nneeds to be kept weed-free right up to the 6-leaf stage,\nwhich requires continual plant monitoring.\n15.1 Crop rotation\nTo achieve the best weed control, choosing the right\ntime for each cultivation measure is particularly\nimportant when growing maize. Regular hoeing after\nmaize emergence is therefore essential to keep rows\nclean. A setting with accuracy to the nearest centimetre\nis recommended. This is usually only possible with a\nrear camera steering system, however.",
    "15.1 Crop rotation": "Maize is usually only grown after other crops or winter cereals, and in combination with a legume catch crop. If\ncereals are used as the preceding crop, extra care must be taken to ensure they are weed-free. Clovers with a close\nC:N ratio offer the ideal option when selected as catch crops, as they generally only supply nitrogen when mature.\nW\nOne possible reinforced crop rotation: Red clover - Cereals - Maize",
    "15.2 Sowing": "Successful weed control for maize is significantly influence by a late sowing date and choosing maize varieties that\noffer good weed suppression. To ensure young plants develop quickly, the soil temperature during seed sowing\nshould be at least 8°C (preferably 10°C) over a long period of time.\nA sowing unit on the maize drill must be precisely coordinated with the hoeing\nelement row spacing: 75 cm (29.50\") needs to be precisely 75 cm (29.50\"), for\nexample.",
    "15.3 Undersowing": "Undersown crops can be sown into the maize crop using\na drill on the row-crop cultivator. This is predominantly\nan option for the final pass of hoeing. Clovers and\ngrasses are best for undersowing. Undersown crops\ncan also be sown using a weeder equipped with a drill.\nThe main advantage of undersown crops is that they\nsuppress weeds, reduce erosion, and provide excellent\nsoil conditions. On one hand, undersowing supports\nsoil life, on the other, it makes the ground better to\ndrive over during harvesting due to the widespread\ngrowth.",
    "15.4 Mechanical weed control in maize": "1. 2. 3. Blind weeding (essential) Blind weeding\nshould be carried out shortly after sowing (3-7\ndays after), using the tined weeder to control\nthe first weed seedlings. To successfully plan\nthis in, the sowing date must be coordinated\nwith the blind weeding pass, and this must\nbe taken into consideration when review the\nweather conditions. At this stage, weed germ\ntubes are easily eliminated, greatly reducing\nthe subsequent weed pressure. However, be\ncareful not to weed too early, as this will not be\nsuccessful. And don’t weed too late, or seedlings\nmay be damaged.\nWeed as required: If necessary, an additional\nweeding pass can be carried out no faster than\n2-4 km/h in the 2-3-leaf stage. If the working\nspeed exceeds this, plants may be buried or\nset on an incline. The maize plants will then be\nslow to straighten and will lag behind in growth\nand development. At this growth stage, the crop\nshould be blind weeded in the morning on warm\ndays when the plants become more flexible\nin the heat of the sun. This stops them from\nbending over.\nPractical tip: Weeding crossways effectively\nburies weed seedlings between the rows.\nTechnical tip: The CHOPSTAR-TWIN precision\nhoe is suitable for use at this stage. This hoe\noffers the crucial benefit that is works extremely\nclose to the crop, meaning it can be used to\nhoe very young crops. It also produces a very\nnarrow unhoed band of less than 5 cm (2\"), which\nensures crops are cleaner and weed infestations\nare reduced.\nBreak crusts as required: If the soil is heavily\ncrusted, use a rotary hoe to aerate the soil and\ninterrupt the capillary effect.4. 5. Hoe from the 2-leaf stage: Approx. 1 week after\na weeder pass, the row should be hoed as close\nand flat as possible. Camera steering on the row-\ncrop cultivator will assist the tractor driver and\ncompensate for any mistakes. If the pass works\ntoo deeply, seeds will germinate and moist soil\nwill be brought to the surface, increasing the risk\nof erosion.\nDepending on the maize crop and weed pressure,\n2–3 more hoeing passes can be carried out. To\ncontrol weeds between plants in the row, finger\nhoes and rotative weeder elements can be fitted.\nThe basic rule is: hoe whenever necessary, but as\nlittle as possible.\nLast hoeing pass just before row closure: Tines\nshould be set close together during the final\nhoeing pass, so that roots are undamaged.\nHilling recommended: Just before the end\nof each row, we recommend setting heaping\nsweeps or discs. When the maize is approx. 40\ncm (15.70\") high, small weeds in the rows can be\nburied resulting in less weed pressure. The plant\nwill also benefit from the “hill effect”. Faster\nworking speeds and ridging tools are used to\nearth more soil into the row. This encourages the\nsoil over the plant roots to warm up thanks to\nthe larger surface area created and guarantees\nmore rapid growth.Once the row is covered, no\nfurther crop care measures are required/possible.\nIf, however, hoeing is, or needs to be done due to\nerosion or incrustations, a finger feeler can help\ncontrol the sideshift frame when hoeing shortly\nafter row closure.Mechanical weed control with the rotary hoe in maize\n1. 2. \"Blind weeding\" or \"blind hoeing\" to the maize plant tips (pay attention to working depth)\nAs required from the 2-leaf stage",

For\nthis reason, wheat, barley and rye are often grown\nafter rapeseed. Rapeseed requires a lot of nutrients;\ntherefore a good supply of nitrogen is important. This\ncrop also requires a good supply of lime.\nPests and disease constitute the main risks for organic\nrapeseed.",
    "22.1 Crop rotation": "The preceding crop requirements are relatively high in\nterms of N. It is important the preceding crop is sown\nearly to allow enough time for tillage and sowing.\nCultivation breaks of 6 years are required and care\nmust be taken with crops in the rotation such as soy\nand sunflower which are susceptible to sclerotinioa.\nAvoid including sugar beet in this crop rotation\nCompanion sowing/undersowing\nas rapeseed acts as a host plant for the beet cyst\nnematode. Successful cultivation relies on rapid early\ndevelopment in autumn, and this requires sufficient\nnitrogen. Preceding crops such as clover grass, grain\nlegumes and winter barley help perfectly in this\nrespect.Companion sowing plays a key role in securing\nsuccessful organic rapeseed cultivation. Good choices\nmade at this point increase soil fertility and increase\nthe soil’s yield capacity in a sustainable manner. In\npractice, companion sowing only works when rapeseed\nis grown in row, as companion sowing goes between\nthe rows. Companion sowing is suitable for drilled\nrapeseed, but low weed pressure must be ensured for\nthis to be successful.\n» Companion sowing results in covered soil, which in\nturn results in reduced weed pressure.\n» Nitrogen-fixing plants in the companion crop such\nas legumes, absorb nitrogen in the air, store it and\nrelease it for the rapeseed, thus increasing the\nrapeseed’s supply.\n» Plants like oil flax, lupins and legumes with\nmycorrhizal symbiosis can be chosen to promote\nsoil life. This is required because rapeseed is a\ncruciferous plant and as such, does not perform\nthis symbiosis.\n» In autumn, plants freeze for the winter and form\na mulch layer which protects against soil erosion.\nThis turns into humus in spring.\n» When growing rapeseed, it is crucial to promote\nstrong autumn plant growth, and to prevent\nuncontrolled sprouting. This will result in resilient\noverwintering and a successful harvest.\n» In autumn, the flea beetle can cause significant\ndamage to this crop. Sowing a companion crop\ncan act as a diversion and this protective measure\nhas great value. Flea beetles cannot spread as\nrapidly, and they infest both the rapeseed and the\ncompanion crop.\n» Ideal companion seeds: mungo, horse beans,\nalexandrine clover, linseed, lentils\nPhacelia would make a good companion seed, however it should not be included\nin the mix, as together with rapeseed, they encourage each other to sprout.",
    "22.2 Sowing": "Standard seed drills can be used as well as single grain\nseed drills for rows. The ideal sowing time is mid to\nlate August. The seedbed should be fine-crumbled\nand nicely settled. Early sowing allows the plants to\nabsorb nitrogen and promotes plant growth so that\nthey can overwinter better. The aim is for these plants\nto overwinter as well-developed rosettes with 8 to\n10 (0.31 to 0.39\") leaves, a root crown diameter of a\nminimum of 8 to 10 mm (0.31 to 0.39\") and a taproot\nlength of 15 to 20 cm (5.90 to 7.90\"). Rapeseed should\nnot bolt before winter. The higher the root collar, the\ngreater the risk during winter.\nThe shelf depth should be approx. 3 cm (1.20\") -\ndepending on water supply, this may vary. If there is\nsufficient water, the crop should be placed relatively\nshallow. If there is less water available, placement\nshould be a little deeper.\nPlant rapeseed in wide rows of 25 - 50 cm (9.80 - 19.70\") to make hoeing\npossible.",
    "22.3 Mechanical weed control in rapeseed": "1. 2. 3. 1-2 weeder passes before sowing: Good soil\ncultivation is important here. Soil is usually\nploughed, as blind weeding is often tricky due to\nthe shallow sowing depth of rapeseed. Weeding\ntoo early after emergence can damage these\nplants. We suggest weeding once or twice pre-\nsowing.\nWeeding after emergence: Only gentle use of the\ntined weeder is possible after plant emergence,\nand without a lot of pressure. This makes results\nunconvincing. It is therefore often possible to\navoid a weeder pass altogether.\nHoeing: If the rapeseed has been sown in rows,\nhoeing can control weeds, and this has proven\neffective. Recently, row spacings of 25-50 cm\n(9.80-19.70\") have become standard. When\nwider row spacings are chosen, rows do not\nentirely close, meaning weeds can grow through\non a continuing basis. One or two hoeing passes\nshould be carried out in autumn and another in\nspring if necessary.\nTined weeding of rapeseed is tricky and requires precision.",
    "22.4 Mechanical weed control in rapeseed: The TOP 5": "1\nAdhere to growing breaks (crop rotation).\n2\nDo not include cruciferous and sclerotinia-susceptible crops in the crop rotation.\n3\nCompanion sowing helps with weed suppression and the development of organic rapeseed.\n4\nA fine, level seedbed is important.\n5\nBlind weeding is extremely demanding.\n6\nWhen sown in rows, the hoe can be an effective weed control measure."

  "23. MECHANICAL WEED CONTROL IN PEAS": {"23": "Grain peas bind nitrogen from the air and add it to the\nsoil, promoting soil life. This makes this crop a good\npreceding crop to cereals and potatoes. Peas have a\nsymbiotic relationship with the nodule bacteria that\ncolonise their roots. This bacteria utilises the pea's\nroot excretions, while binding nitrogen from the air.\nThe pea then uses the nitrogen to grow and form\nprotein, meaning the pea does not require any extra\nnitrogen fertilisation when cultivated.\nFor optimum growth, peas need nutrient-rich, light to\nmedium-heavy soil, sufficient sunlight, and a constant\nsupply of water. Very light sandy soils and very heavy\nclay soils are not suitable. Good soil aeration is vital as\nis supports the formation of the nodule bacteria, which\nensures the yield will be high. During germination and\nflowering, water supply is extra important, however\ntake care that the soil does not become waterlogged.\nFor a high yield harvest, make sure there is adequate\nlime available in the soil. The pH value should be\nabove 6.",
    "23.1 Crop rotation": "Grain peas make few demands on the preceding crop,\nand are usually grown after a second or third crop.\nClover grass, grain legumes and catch crop legumes\nare not suitable as preceding crops, however cereal,\nmaize and potatoes are. Fields must be free of couch\ngrass and other weeds.\n23.2 Sowing\nThis crop leaves behind a good soil structure, and their\nharvest, removes around 40-60 kg of nitrogen/hectare.\nGood following crops include barley, wheat, triticale\nand potatoes. Cultivation breaks of more than 6 years\nneed to be ensured, as peas are self-incompatible.",
    "23.2 Sowing": "When to grow peas depends on the weather and region.\nIt generally occurs between the end of February and\nthe beginning of April. Early sowing is beneficial as\nlong as the soil is sufficiently dry, warm and drivable.\nThis crop is extremely sensitive to soil smearing and\nsoil compaction. It also reacts poorly to frost, therefore\nshould not be grown too early in the year. Avoid soil\ncompaction and waterlogging in the field.\nThe recommended sowing rate is 70-90 seeds per\nm2. The usual guidelines apply: Increase the sowing\nrate by 10% to compensate for weeding losses. An\neven and finely crumbled seedbed is important. The\nsowing depth should be 4-6 cm (1.60-2.40\") due to\nthe high water demand of this crop. Ensure uniform,\ndeep seed placement to ensure good weeding results.\nPeas can be grown as a mixed crop with oats, or even\nbetter, barley, due to their similar maturation rate. The\nadditional crop then acts to suppress weeds, which\ncan be a problem for peas as they grow slowly when\nyoung. The peas then return the favour for the second\ncrop and protect against late weed infestations, leaf\nfall, and provide support for stored cereals.\nAs a result, peas are often grown in a mixed crop. See\nthe section “Undersowing and mixed crops”.\nIncrease the sowing rate by 10% to compensate for weeding losses.",
    "23.3 Mechanical weed control in peas": "1. 2. 3. 4. 5. Blind weeding: This should take place 4-6 days\nafter sowing. It is important that the first weeds\nare controlled shortly after the sowing date as\nthe peas are sown deeply and grow slowly when\nyoung. Weeding should be careful and should be\ncarried out during higher daytime temperatures\nor around midday.\n2nd tined weeder pass: after crop emergence. Do\nnot weed before this point as peas are sensitive\nto mechanical interventions. Peas should not be\nweeded until they reach the 3-leaf stage. Once\nthey are 5-10 cm (2-3.90\") tall, any damage is\nminor and even buried plants can keep growing.\nHoeing: As soon as the camera registers the plant\nrow, carry out 1-3 hoeing passes depending on\nrequirements and weed pressure (this is only\npossible with large row spacings). Finger hoes are\nvery effective when controlling weeds in rows of\npeas. CAUTION: be gentle and avoid burying the\npeas.\nThe rotary hoe can break any crusts pre-weeding\nensuring that this pass is efficient.\nAdditional tined weeder passes: Depending\non the weather, plants can be weeded until\ntheir tendrils start to meet. Once the peas bolt\nhowever, weeding is not possible as plants can\neasily be caught in the tines and pulled out.\nDo not entirely cover grain peas with soil.\nThe rotary hoe can break crusts during early crop growth.",
    "23.4 Mechanical weed control in peas: The TOP 5": "1\nPeas need a deep, light to medium-heavy soil.\n2\nSow only if the soil is sufficiently dry.\n3\nBlind weeding is very important due to peas’ slow juvenile development.\n4\nHoe as soon as the camera recognises the plant rows.\n5\nAvoid weeding from crop emergence to the 3-leaf stage."
